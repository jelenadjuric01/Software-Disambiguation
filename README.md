# Software-Disambiguation
Tackling the problem of software disambiguation in texts using Python and semi supervised machine learning. 
Idea is to create a program that will do software name disambiguation properly based on metadata that includes more than just a name. Main problem is that there are software that have the same name, but refer to a different thing (homonyms) and software that can be written in my ways or have a typo, but refer to the same thing (synonyms). Input file will be csv that will have name of the software, as well as metadata like paper where the software was mentioned, authors of the paper, paragraph surrounding the mention of the software. Synonyms of the software name will be fetched and included into the input file, as well as URLs where one of them is the one that software refers to. A csv file will be produced in order to evaluate the success of disambiguation. Software will from the possible URL candidates for the name disambiguate which one is the one that the software name refers to using supervised learning techniques. Given a software mention and metadata needed, the software will search the internet and return possible URLs that the software refers to, with a label yes or no. More than one URL can be right.
