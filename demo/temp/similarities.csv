From this discussion will come a statistical plan for a (non-randomized) validation trial. Both prospective and retrospective trials are supported. In a specific focused discussion, investigators should determine the range of """"discomfort"""" for the NNT, number needed to treat.  The meaning of the discomfort range, [NNTlower, NNTupper], is that within this range most physicians would feel discomfort either in treating or withholding treatment. A pair of NNT values bracketing that range, NNTpos and NNTneg, become the targets of the study's design.  If the trial can demonstrate that a positive biomarker test yields an NNT less than NNTlower, and that a negative biomarker test yields an NNT less than NNTlower, then the biomarker may be useful for patients. A highlight of the package is visualization of a """"contra-Bayes"""" theorem, which produces criteria for retrospective case-controls studies.",R,0.8611111111111112,0.594017094017094,0.2966277003288269,,0.7718792748904794,0

From this discussion will come a statistical plan for a (non-randomized) validation trial. Both prospective and retrospective trials are supported. In a specific focused discussion, investigators should determine the range of """"discomfort"""" for the NNT, number needed to treat.  The meaning of the discomfort range, [NNTlower, NNTupper], is that within this range most physicians would feel discomfort either in treating or withholding treatment. A pair of NNT values bracketing that range, NNTpos and NNTneg, become the targets of the study's design.  If the trial can demonstrate that a positive biomarker test yields an NNT less than NNTlower, and that a negative biomarker test yields an NNT less than NNTlower, then the biomarker may be useful for patients.

From this discussion will come a statistical plan for a (non-randomized) validation trial. Both prospective and retrospective trials are supported. In a specific focused discussion, investigators should determine the range of """"discomfort"""" for the NNT, number needed to treat.  The meaning of the discomfort range, [NNTlower, NNTupper], is that within this range most physicians would feel discomfort either in treating or withholding treatment. A pair of NNT values bracketing that range, NNTpos and NNTneg, become the targets of the study's design.  If the trial can demonstrate that a positive biomarker test yields an NNT less than NNTlower, and that a negative biomarker test yields an NNT less than NNTlower, then the biomarker may be useful for patients.

Both one-step and targeted minimum loss estimators are implemented for the counterfactual mean value of an outcome of interest under an additive modified treatment policy, a stochastic intervention that may depend on the natural value of the exposure. To accommodate settings with outcome-dependent two-phase sampling, procedures incorporating inverse probability of censoring weighting are provided to facilitate the construction of inefficient and efficient one-step and targeted minimum loss estimators.  The causal parameter and its estimation were first described by Díaz and van der Laan (2013) <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01685.x>, while the multiply robust estimation procedure and its application to data from two-phase sampling designs is detailed in NS Hejazi, MJ van der Laan, HE Janes, PB Gilbert, and DC Benkeser (2020) <doi:10.1111/biom.13375>.

Other explanatory variable such as additional sample measures (e.g. age, height, weight) or batch effects can also be included. For linear mixed models, in addition to the fixed effects of the genotype and the covariates, different random effect components can be included, accounting for population structure in the study cohort or environmental effects. The application of linear and linear mixed models in quantitative genetics ranges from genetic studies in model organism such as yeast and *Arabidopsis thaliana* to human molecular, morphological or imaging derived traits. Developing new methods for increasing numbers of sample cohorts, phenotypic measurements or complexity of phenotypes to analyse, often requires the simulation of datasets with a specific underlying phenotype structure.   **PhenotypeSimulator** allows for the simulation of complex phenotypes under different models, including genetic variant effects and infinitesimal genetic effects (reflecting population structure) as well as correlated, non-genetic covariates and observational noise effects. Different phenotypic effects can be combined into a final phenotype while controlling for the proportion of variance explained by each of the components. For each component, the number of variables, their distribution and the design of their effect across traits can be customised.",R,0.27777777777777773,0.45457957957957956,0.14564283192157745,,0.44379701666610555,0

For each effect component, the number of variables, their distribution and the design of their effect across traits can be customised. For the simulation of the genetic effects, external genotype data from a number of standard software ('plink', 'hapgen2'/ 'impute2', 'genome', 'bimbam', simple text files) can be imported. The final simulated phenotypes and its components can be automatically saved into .rds or .csv files. In addition, they can be saved in formats compatible with commonly used genetic association software ('gemma', 'bimbam', 'plink', 'snptest', 'LiMMBo').",R,0.27777777777777773,0.5236403069736403,0.29620862007141113,,0.44379701666610555,0

Other explanatory variable such as additional sample measures (e.g. age, height, weight) or batch effects can also be included. For linear mixed models, in addition to the fixed effects of the genotype and the covariates, different random effect components can be included, accounting for population structure in the study cohort or environmental effects. The application of linear and linear mixed models in quantitative genetics ranges from genetic studies in model organism such as yeast and *Arabidopsis thaliana* to human molecular, morphological or imaging derived traits. Developing new methods for increasing numbers of sample cohorts, phenotypic measurements or complexity of phenotypes to analyse, often requires the simulation of datasets with a specific underlying phenotype structure.   **PhenotypeSimulator** allows for the simulation of complex phenotypes under different models, including genetic variant effects and infinitesimal genetic effects (reflecting population structure) as well as correlated, non-genetic covariates and observational noise effects. Different phenotypic effects can be combined into a final phenotype while controlling for the proportion of variance explained by each of the components.

Other explanatory variable such as additional sample measures (e.g. age, height, weight) or batch effects can also be included. For linear mixed models, in addition to the fixed effects of the genotype and the covariates, different random effect components can be included, accounting for population structure in the study cohort or environmental effects. The application of linear and linear mixed models in quantitative genetics ranges from genetic studies in model organism such as yeast and *Arabidopsis thaliana* to human molecular, morphological or imaging derived traits. Developing new methods for increasing numbers of sample cohorts, phenotypic measurements or complexity of phenotypes to analyse, often requires the simulation of datasets with a specific underlying phenotype structure.   **PhenotypeSimulator** allows for the simulation of complex phenotypes under different models, including genetic variant effects and infinitesimal genetic effects (reflecting population structure) as well as correlated, non-genetic covariates and observational noise effects. Different phenotypic effects can be combined into a final phenotype while controlling for the proportion of variance explained by each of the components. For each component, the number of variables, their distribution and the design of their effect across traits can be customised.",R,0.27777777777777773,0.47572572572572575,-0.037009961903095245,,0.44379701666610555,0

'PhenotypeSimulator' allows for the flexible simulation of phenotypes under different models, including genetic variant and  infinitesimal genetic effects (reflecting population structure) as well as non-genetic covariate effects, observational noise and additional correlation effects. The different phenotype components are combined into a final phenotype while controlling for the proportion of variance explained by each of the components. For each effect component, the number of variables, their distribution and the design of their effect across traits can be customised. For the simulation of the genetic effects, external genotype data from a number of standard software ('plink', 'hapgen2'/ 'impute2', 'genome', 'bimbam', simple text files) can be imported. The final simulated phenotypes and its components can be automatically saved into .rds or .csv files. In addition, they can be saved in formats compatible with commonly used genetic association software ('gemma', 'bimbam', 'plink', 'snptest', 'LiMMBo').",R,0.27777777777777773,0.5759600179890034,0.1616658866405487,,0.44379701666610555,0

Other explanatory variable such as additional sample measures (e.g. age, height, weight) or batch effects can also be included. For linear mixed models, in addition to the fixed effects of the genotype and the covariates, different random effect components can be included, accounting for population structure in the study cohort or environmental effects. The application of linear and linear mixed models in quantitative genetics ranges from genetic studies in model organism such as yeast and *Arabidopsis thaliana* to human molecular, morphological or imaging derived traits. Developing new methods for increasing numbers of sample cohorts, phenotypic measurements or complexity of phenotypes to analyse, often requires the simulation of datasets with a specific underlying phenotype structure.   **PhenotypeSimulator** allows for the simulation of complex phenotypes under different models, including genetic variant effects and infinitesimal genetic effects (reflecting population structure) as well as correlated, non-genetic covariates and observational noise effects. Different phenotypic effects can be combined into a final phenotype while controlling for the proportion of variance explained by each of the components. For each component, the number of variables, their distribution and the design of their effect across traits can be customised.",R,0.27777777777777773,0.4670852359208523,0.12609758973121643,,0.44379701666610555,0

'PhenotypeSimulator' allows for the flexible simulation of phenotypes under different models, including genetic variant and  infinitesimal genetic effects (reflecting population structure) as well as non-genetic covariate effects, observational noise and additional correlation effects. The different phenotype components are combined into a final phenotype while controlling for the proportion of variance explained by each of the components. For each effect component, the number of variables, their distribution and the design of their effect across traits can be customised. For the simulation of the genetic effects, external genotype data from a number of standard software ('plink', 'hapgen2'/ 'impute2', 'genome', 'bimbam', simple text files) can be imported. The final simulated phenotypes and its components can be automatically saved into .rds or .csv files. In addition, they can be saved in formats compatible with commonly used genetic association software ('gemma', 'bimbam', 'plink', 'snptest', 'LiMMBo').",R,0.27777777777777773,0.5215711144934889,0.2822982668876648,,0.44379701666610555,0

Other explanatory variable such as additional sample measures (e.g. age, height, weight) or batch effects can also be included. For linear mixed models, in addition to the fixed effects of the genotype and the covariates, different random effect components can be included, accounting for population structure in the study cohort or environmental effects. The application of linear and linear mixed models in quantitative genetics ranges from genetic studies in model organism such as yeast and *Arabidopsis thaliana* to human molecular, morphological or imaging derived traits. Developing new methods for increasing numbers of sample cohorts, phenotypic measurements or complexity of phenotypes to analyse, often requires the simulation of datasets with a specific underlying phenotype structure.   **PhenotypeSimulator** allows for the simulation of complex phenotypes under different models, including genetic variant effects and infinitesimal genetic effects (reflecting population structure) as well as correlated, non-genetic covariates and observational noise effects. Different phenotypic effects can be combined into a final phenotype while controlling for the proportion of variance explained by each of the components.

Prior distributions on coefficients are from Zellner's g-prior or mixtures of g-priors corresponding to the Zellner-Siow Cauchy Priors or the mixture of g-priors from Liang et al (2008) <DOI:10.1198/016214507000001337> for linear models or mixtures of g-priors from  Li and Clyde (2019) <DOI:10.1080/01621459.2018.1469992> in generalized linear models. Other model selection criteria include AIC, BIC and Empirical Bayes estimates of g. Sampling probabilities may be updated based on the sampled models using sampling w/out replacement or an efficient MCMC algorithm which samples models using a tree structure of the model space as an efficient hash table.  See  Clyde, Ghosh and Littman (2010) <DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.09049> for  details on the sampling algorithms. Uniform priors over all models or beta-binomial prior distributions on model size are allowed, and for large p truncated priors on the model space may be used to enforce sampling models that are full rank. The user may force variables to always be included in addition to imposing constraints that higher order interactions are included only if their parents are included in the model.

Prior distributions on coefficients are from Zellner's g-prior or mixtures of g-priors corresponding to the Zellner-Siow Cauchy Priors or the mixture of g-priors from Liang et al (2008) <DOI:10.1198/016214507000001337> for linear models or mixtures of g-priors from  Li and Clyde (2019) <DOI:10.1080/01621459.2018.1469992> in generalized linear models. Other model selection criteria include AIC, BIC and Empirical Bayes estimates of g. Sampling probabilities may be updated based on the sampled models using sampling w/out replacement or an efficient MCMC algorithm which samples models using a tree structure of the model space as an efficient hash table.  See  Clyde, Ghosh and Littman (2010) <DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.09049> for  details on the sampling algorithms. Uniform priors over all models or beta-binomial prior distributions on model size are allowed, and for large p truncated priors on the model space may be used to enforce sampling models that are full rank. The user may force variables to always be included in addition to imposing constraints that higher order interactions are included only if their parents are included in the model.

It can calculate pairwise distances between individuals using a stepwise mutation model or infinite alleles model, with or without taking ploidies and allele frequencies into account.  These distances can be used for the calculation of clonal diversity statistics or used for further analysis in R.  Allelic diversity statistics and Polymorphic Information Content are also available.  polysat can assist the user in estimating the ploidy of samples, and it can estimate allele frequencies in populations, calculate pairwise or global differentiation statistics based on those frequencies, and export allele frequencies to 'SPAGeDi' and 'adegenet'.

Except for their qualitative heterogeneity, different data records exist for describing similar Earth system process at different spatio-temporal scales. Data inter-comparison and validation are usually performed at a single spatial or temporal scale, which could hamper the identification of potential discrepancies in other scales. 'csa' package offers a simple, yet efficient, graphical method for synthesizing and comparing observed and modelled data across a range of spatio-temporal scales. Instead of focusing at specific scales, such as annual means or original grid resolution, we examine how their statistical properties change across spatio-temporal continuum.",R,0.0,0.5468459727581098,0.14103245735168457,,,0
