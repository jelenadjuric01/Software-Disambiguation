    "   - `name` (software mention)\n",
    "   - `doi` (paper DOI)\n",
    "   - `paragraph` (context around the mention)\n",
    "   - `candidate_urls` (optional, comma-separated list of URLs)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Manual input**: If no CSV is provided, you'll be prompted to enter:\n",
    "   - Software name (as mentioned in the paper)\n",
    "   - Paragraph\n",
    "   - DOI\n",
    "   - Candidate URLs (optional, comma-separated)\n",
