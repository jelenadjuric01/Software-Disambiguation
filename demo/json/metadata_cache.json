It implements a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler using 'Rcpp' to compute a Bayesian estimate of what we call the heterozygote miscall rate for restriction-associated digest (RAD) sequencing data and other types of reduced representation GBS data. It also provides functions to generate plots of expected and observed genotype frequencies. Some background on these topics can be found in a recent paper \"Recent advances in conservation and population genomics data analysis\" by Hendricks et al. (2018) <doi:10.1111/eva.12659>, and another paper describing the MCMC approach is in preparation with Gordon Luikart and Thierry Gosselin.",

EBM uses machine learning techniques like bagging and boosting to breathe new life into traditional GAMs (Generalized Additive Models). This makes them as accurate as random forests and gradient boosted trees, and also enhances their intelligibility and editability.

A bootstrap restarting iterative segmented quantile algorithm is proposed to estimate the multiple kink quantile regression model conditional on a given number of change points. The number of kinks is also allowed to be unknown. In such case, the backward elimination algorithm and the bootstrap restarting iterative segmented quantile algorithm are combined to select the number of change points based on a quantile BIC. For longitudinal data, we also develop the GEE estimator to incorporate the within-subject correlations.  A score-type based test statistic is also developed for testing the existence of kink effect. The package is based on the paper, ``Wei Zhong, Chuang Wan and Wenyang Zhang (2022). Estimation and inference for multikink quantile regression, JBES'' and ``Chuang Wan, Wei Zhong, Wenyang Zhang and Changliang Zou (2022).

Two extensions have been added to the classic 'sigma.js' visualizations by overriding the underlying 'JavaScript' code, enabling to draw a frame around node labels, and to display labels on multiple lines by parsing line breaks. Other additional functionalities that did not require overriding 'sigma.js' code include toggling node visibility when clicked using a node attribute and highlighting specific edges.

For best results it is important to select the model that accurately\nrepresents your sequence type: for full length proteins, it is recommended to use the default \"precursor\" model. The alternative, \"mature\", model is best suited\nfor mature peptide sequences that represent the final antimicrobial peptide sequence after post-translational processing.

See Vitevitch, M. S., Ercal, G., & Adagarla, B. (2011). Simulating retrieval from a highly clustered network: Implications for spoken word recognition.

APA style has to be implemented when submitting scientific reports in a wide range of research fields, especially in the social sciences. The default output of numbers in the R console or R Markdown and Quarto documents does not meet the APA style requirements, and reformatting results manually can be cumbersome and error-prone. This package covers the automatic conversion of R objects to textual representations that meet the APA style requirements, which can be included in R Markdown or Quarto documents. It covers some basic statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, correlation, chi-squared test, Wilcoxon test) as well as some basic number printing manipulations (formatting p-values, removing leading zeros for numbers that cannot be greater than one, and others). Other packages exist for formatting numbers and tests according to the APA style guidelines, such as 'papaja' (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=papaja>) and 'apa' (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=apa>), but they do not offer all convenience functionality included in 'prmisc'.

This package provides a set of utilities to help users to create subplots and complex plots.",

All single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GWAS are placed in a 'circular genome' according to their location. Then the complete set of SNP association p-values are permuted by rotation with respect to the SNPs' genomic locations. Two testing frameworks are available: permutations at the gene level, and permutations at the SNP level. The permutation at the gene level uses Fisher's combination test to calculate a single gene p-value, followed by the hypergeometric test. The SNP count methodology maps each SNP to pathways/gene-sets and calculates the proportion of SNPs for the real and the permutated datasets above a pre-defined threshold. Genomicper requires a matrix of GWAS association p-values and SNPs annotation to genes. Pathways can be obtained from within the package or can be provided by the user.",

This is achieved in two ways: First, the method of estimating the slope and intercept uses the least-products method rather than more typical least squared error for the \"dependent\" variable. The least products method has no \"dependent\" variable and is scale independent. Second, the plot is rotated such that the resulting regression line is vertical, reducing the suggestion that the vertical axis is the dominant one. The slope can be read relative to either axis equally.",

CRSO\nis based on a theoretical model of cancer in which a cancer rule\nis defined to be a collection of two or more events (i.e., alterations) that are minimally\nsufficient to cause cancer. A cancer rule set is a set of cancer rules that collectively\nare assumed to account for all of ways to cause cancer in the population. In CRSO every\nevent is designated explicitly as a passenger or driver within each patient.\nEach event is associated with a patient-specific, event-specific passenger penalty,\nreflecting how unlikely the event would have happened by chance, i.e., as a passenger.\nCRSO evaluates each rule set by assigning all samples to a rule in the rule set,\nor to the null rule, and then calculating the total statistical penalty from all\nunassigned event. CRSO uses a three phase procedure find the best rule set of\nfixed size K for a range of Ks. A core rule set is then identified from among\nthe best rule sets of size K as the rule set that best balances rule set size and\nstatistical penalty.\nUsers should consult the 'crso' vignette for an example walk through of a full CRSO run.\nThe full description, of the CRSO algorithm is presented in:\nKlein MI, Cannataro V, Townsend J, Stern DF and Zhao H. \"Identifying combinations of cancer driver in individual patients.\"\nBioRxiv 674234 [Preprint].

The package also provides a number of\nplot and test functions for typical model misspecification problems, such as\nover/underdispersion, zero-inflation, and residual spatial, phylogenetic and temporal autocorrelation.",

Visualization functions for predicted changes in allele frequencies include 'shift.dot.ggplot()', 'shift.pie.ggplot()', 'shift.moon.ggplot()', 'shift.waffle.ggplot()' and 'shift.surf.ggplot()' that are made with input data sets that are prepared by helper functions for each visualization method. Examples in the documentation show how to prepare animated climate change graphics through a time series with the 'gganimate' package. Function 'amova.rda()' shows how Analysis of Molecular Variance can be directly conducted with the results from redundancy analysis.",

    "description": "In silico experimental evolution offers a cost-and-time effective means to test evolutionary hypotheses.  Existing evolutionary simulation tools focus on simulations in a limited experimental framework, and tend to report on only the results presumed of interest by the tools designer.  The R-package for Simulated Haploid Asexual Population Evolution ('rSHAPE') addresses these concerns by implementing a robust simulation framework that outputs complete population demographic and genomic information for in silico evolving communities.  Allowing more than 60 parameters to be specified, 'rSHAPE'\tsimulates evolution across discrete time-steps for an evolving community of haploid asexual populations with binary state genomes.  These settings are for the current state of 'rSHAPE' and future steps will be to increase the breadth of evolutionary conditions permitted.  At present, most effort was placed into permitting varied growth models to be simulated (such as constant size, exponential growth, and logistic growth) as well as various fitness landscape models to reflect the evolutionary landscape (e.g.: Additive, House of Cards - Stuart Kauffman and Simon Levin (1987) <doi:10.1016/S0022-5193(87)80029-2>, NK - Stuart A. Kauffman and Edward D. Weinberger (1989) <doi:10.1016/S0022-5193(89)80019-0>, Rough Mount Fuji - Neidhart, Johannes and Szendro, Ivan G and Krug, Joachim (2014) <doi:10.1534/genetics.114.167668>). This package includes numerous functions though users will only need defineSHAPE(), runSHAPE(), shapeExperiment() and summariseExperiment().  All other functions are called by these main functions and are likely only to be on interest for someone wishing to develop 'rSHAPE'.  Simulation results will be stored in files which are exported to the directory referenced by the shape_workDir option (defaults to tempdir() but do change this by passing a folderpath argument for workDir when calling defineSHAPE() if you plan to make use of your results beyond your current session).  'rSHAPE' will generate numerous replicate simulations for your defined range of experimental parameters.  The experiment will be built under the experimental working directory (i.e.: referenced by the option shape_workDir set using defineSHAPE() ) where individual replicate simulation results will be stored as well as processed results which I have made in an effort to facilitate analyses by automating collection and processing of the potentially thousands of files which will be created. On that note, 'rSHAPE' implements a robust and flexible framework with highly detailed output at the cost of computational efficiency and potentially requiring significant disk space (generally gigabytes but up to tera-bytes for very large simulation efforts).  So, while 'rSHAPE' offers a single framework in which we can simulate evolution and directly compare the impacts of a wide range of parameters, it is not as quick to run as other in silico simulation tools which focus on a single scenario with limited output. There you have it, 'rSHAPE' offers you a less restrictive in silico evolutionary playground than other tools and I hope you enjoy testing your hypotheses.",

Generalized cross validation and stability based method were provided to select the tuning parameters. Rand index, adjusted Rand index and Jaccard index were provided to estimate the agreement between estimated cluster memberships and the truth.",

Unbalanced designs are handled by Type II sums of squares as argued in Langsrud (2003) <doi:10.1023/A:1023260610025>. Furthermore, the Type II philosophy is extended to continuous design variables as described in Langsrud et al. (2007) <doi:10.1080/02664760701594246>. This means that the method is invariant to scale changes and that common pitfalls are avoided.",

A class of methods to correct for selection bias is to apply a statistical model to predict the units not in the sample (super-population modeling). Other studies use calibration or Statistical Matching (statistically match nonprobability and probability samples). To date, the more relevant methods are weighting by Propensity Score Adjustment (PSA).\nThe Propensity Score Adjustment method was originally developed to construct weights by estimating response probabilities and using them in Horvitz–Thompson type estimators. This method is usually used by combining a non-probability sample with a reference sample to construct propensity models for the non-probability sample. Calibration can be used in a posterior way to adding information of auxiliary variables.\nPropensity scores in PSA are usually estimated using logistic regression models. Machine learning classification algorithms can be used as alternatives for logistic regression as a technique to estimate propensities.\nThe package 'NonProbEst' implements some of these methods and thus provides a wide options to work with data coming from a non-probabilistic sample.",

    "description": "Background - Traditional gene set enrichment analyses are\ntypically limited to a few ontologies and do not account for the\ninterdependence of gene sets or terms, resulting in overcorrected p-values.\nTo address these challenges, we introduce mulea, an R package offering\ncomprehensive overrepresentation and functional enrichment analysis.\nResults - mulea employs a progressive empirical false discovery rate\n(eFDR) method, specifically designed for interconnected biological data,\nto accurately identify significant terms within diverse ontologies. mulea\nexpands beyond traditional tools by incorporating a wide range of\nontologies, encompassing Gene Ontology, pathways, regulatory elements,\ngenomic locations, and protein domains. This flexibility enables\nresearchers to tailor enrichment analysis to their specific questions,\nsuch as identifying enriched transcriptional regulators in gene expression\ndata or overrepresented protein domains in protein sets. To facilitate\nseamless analysis, mulea provides gene sets (in standardised GMT format)\nfor 27 model organisms, covering 22 ontology types from 16 databases and\nvarious identifiers resulting in almost 900 files. Additionally, the\nmuleaData ExperimentData Bioconductor package simplifies access to these\npre-defined ontologies. Finally, mulea's architecture allows for easy\nintegration of user-defined ontologies, or GMT files from external\nsources (e.g., MSigDB or Enrichr), expanding its applicability across\ndiverse research areas. Conclusions - mulea is distributed as a CRAN R\npackage. It offers researchers a powerful and flexible toolkit for\nfunctional enrichment analysis, addressing limitations of traditional\ntools with its progressive eFDR and by supporting a variety of ontologies.\nOverall, mulea fosters the exploration of diverse biological questions\nacross various model organisms.",

Four multiple imputation methods are proposed, two are based on joint modelling and two are fully sequential methods, as discussed in  Audigier et al. (2021) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2106.04424>. II) cluster analysis of imputed data sets. Six clustering methods are available (distances-based or model-based), but custom methods can also be easily used. III) Partition pooling. The set of partitions is aggregated using Non-negative Matrix Factorization based method. An associated instability measure is computed by bootstrap (see Fang, Y. and Wang, J., 2012 <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2011.09.003>). Among applications, this instability measure can be used to choose a number of clusters with missing values.\nThe package also proposes several diagnostic tools to tune the number of imputed data sets, to tune the number of iterations in fully sequential imputation, to check the fit of imputation models, etc.",

Here, a swarm system called Databionic swarm (DBS) is introduced which was published in Thrun, M.C., Ultsch A.: \"Swarm Intelligence for Self-Organized Clustering\" (2020), Artificial Intelligence, <DOI:10.1016/j.artint.2020.103237>. DBS is able to adapt itself to structures of high-dimensional data such as natural clusters characterized by distance and/or density based structures in the data space. The first module is the parameter-free projection method called Pswarm (Pswarm()), which exploits the concepts of self-organization and emergence, game theory, swarm intelligence and symmetry considerations. The second module is the parameter-free high-dimensional data visualization technique, which generates projected points on the topographic map with hypsometric tints defined by the generalized U-matrix (GeneratePswarmVisualization()). The third module is the clustering method itself with non-critical parameters (DBSclustering()). Clustering can be verified by the visualization and vice versa. The term DBS refers to the method as a whole. It enables even a non-professional in the field of data mining to apply its algorithms for visualization and/or clustering to data sets with completely different structures drawn from diverse research fields. The comparison to common projection methods can be found in the book of Thrun, M.C.: \"Projection Based Clustering through Self-Organization and Swarm Intelligence\" (2018) <DOI:10.1007/978-3-658-20540-9>.",

Package functions are carefully implemented in C++ for squeezing computing speed, suitable for large input in a manycore environment. Precision of the approximation and computing speed both substantially outperform various CRAN packages to date. Benchmarks are detailed in function examples. A simple heuristic algorithm is additionally designed to optimize the joint distribution in the post-simulation stage. The heuristic demonstrated good potential of achieving the same level of precision of approximation without the enhanced Iman-Conover-Ruscio-Kaczetow.

The SETAR-Tree uses some time-series-specific splitting and stopping procedures. It trains global pooled regression models in the leaves allowing the models to learn cross-series information. The depth of the tree is controlled by conducting a statistical linearity test as well as measuring the error reduction percentage at each node split. Thus, the SETAR-Tree requires minimal external hyperparameter tuning and provides competitive results under its default configuration. A forest is developed by extending the SETAR-Tree. The SETAR-Forest combines the forecasts provided by a collection of diverse SETAR-Trees during the forecasting process.",

Given one or more risk prediction instruments (risk models) that estimate the probability of a binary outcome, rmda provides functions to estimate and display decision curves and other figures that help assess the population impact of using a risk model for clinical decision making.   Here, \"population\" refers to the relevant patient population. Decision curves display estimates of the (standardized) net benefit over a range of probability thresholds used to categorize observations as 'high risk'. The curves help evaluate a treatment policy that recommends treatment for patients who are estimated to be 'high risk' by comparing the population impact of a risk-based policy to \"treat all\" and \"treat none\" intervention policies.  Curves can be estimated using data from a prospective cohort.  In addition, rmda can estimate decision curves using data from a case-control study if an estimate of the population outcome prevalence is available.  Version 1.4 of the package provides an alternative framing of the decision problem for situations where treatment is the standard-of-care and a risk model might be used to recommend that low-risk patients (i.e., patients below some risk threshold) opt out of treatment. Confidence intervals calculated using the bootstrap can be computed and displayed. A wrapper function to calculate cross-validated curves using k-fold cross-validation is also provided.",

Perhaps the most significant feature is the package's ability to make predictions\nusing the 40 pre trained models on totally new (untrained) data if the user selects that feature. This feature alone represents a very effective solution\nto the issue of reproducibility of models in data science.

For example, the package automatically calculates the Kolmogorov-Smirnov\ntest for each of the 40 models and plots a bar chart of the results, a bias bar chart of each of the 40 models, as well as several plots for exploratory data\nanalysis (automatic histograms of the numeric data, automatic histograms of the numeric data). The package also automatically creates a summary report\nthat can be both sorted and searched for each of the 40 models, including RMSE, bias, train RMSE, test RMSE, validation RMSE, overfitting and duration.\nThe best results on the holdout data typically beat the best results in data science competitions and published results for the same data set.",

Valid allocations must satisfy no-subsidy constraints,\nmeaning that no group of agents contributes more than the highest cost of\nits members (i.e., no agent is allowed to subsidize another). A rule is a\nmechanism that selects an allocation vector for a given problem. This\npackage computes several rules proposed in the literature, including both\nstandard rules and their variants, such as weighted versions, rules for\nclones, and rules based on the agents’ hierarchy order. These rules can be\napplied to various problems of interest, including the allocation of\nliabilities and the maintenance of irrigation systems, among others.\nMoreover, the package provides functions for graphical representation,\nenabling users to visually compare the outcomes produced by each rule,\nor to display the no-subsidy set. In addition, it includes four datasets\nillustrating different applications and examples of airport problems.

Given one or more risk prediction instruments (risk models) that estimate the probability of a binary outcome, rmda provides functions to estimate and display decision curves and other figures that help assess the population impact of using a risk model for clinical decision making.   Here, \"population\" refers to the relevant patient population. Decision curves display estimates of the (standardized) net benefit over a range of probability thresholds used to categorize observations as 'high risk'. The curves help evaluate a treatment policy that recommends treatment for patients who are estimated to be 'high risk' by comparing the population impact of a risk-based policy to \"treat all\" and \"treat none\" intervention policies.  Curves can be estimated using data from a prospective cohort.  In addition, rmda can estimate decision curves using data from a case-control study if an estimate of the population outcome prevalence is available.  Version 1.4 of the package provides an alternative framing of the decision problem for situations where treatment is the standard-of-care and a risk model might be used to recommend that low-risk patients (i.e., patients below some risk threshold) opt out of treatment. Confidence intervals calculated using the bootstrap can be computed and displayed. A wrapper function to calculate cross-validated curves using k-fold cross-validation is also provided.",

(i) For sampling at one time point, simulations are performed under a constant rate birth-death process, conditioned on having a fixed number of final tips (sim.bd.taxa()), or a fixed age (sim.bd.age()), or a fixed age and number of tips (sim.bd.taxa.age()). When conditioning on the number of final tips, the method allows for shifts in rates and mass extinction events during the birth-death process (sim.rateshift.taxa()). The function sim.bd.age() (and sim.rateshift.taxa() without extinction) allow the speciation rate to change in a density-dependent way. The LTT plots of the simulations can be displayed using LTT.plot(), LTT.plot.gen() and LTT.average.root(). TreeSim further samples trees with n final tips from a set of trees generated by the common sampling algorithm stopping when a fixed number m>>n of tips is first reached (sim.gsa.taxa()). This latter method is appropriate for m-tip trees generated under a big class of models (details in the sim.gsa.taxa() man page). For incomplete phylogeny, the missing speciation events can be added through simulations (corsim()). (ii) sim.rateshifts.taxa() is generalized to sim.bdsky.stt() for serially sampled trees, where the trees are conditioned on either the number of sampled tips or the age. Furthermore, for a multitype-branching process with sequential sampling, trees on a fixed number of tips can be simulated using sim.bdtypes.stt.taxa(). This function further allows to simulate under epidemiological models with an exposed class. The function sim.genespeciestree() simulates coalescent gene trees within birth-death species trees, and sim.genetree() simulates coalescent gene trees.",

However, the main focus of hydroPSO is the calibration of environmental and other real-world models that need to be executed from the system console. hydroPSO is model-independent, allowing the user to easily interface any computer simulation model with the calibration engine (PSO). hydroPSO  communicates with the model through the model's own input and output files, without requiring access to the model's source code. Several PSO variants and controlling options are included to fine-tune the performance of the calibration engine to different calibration problems. An advanced sensitivity analysis function together with user-friendly plotting summaries facilitate the interpretation and assessment of the calibration results. hydroPSO is parallel-capable, to alleviate the computational burden of complex models with \"long\" execution time.

The methods used improve the major weaknesses of size, power, and robustness of long-run statistical tests described in Kothari/Warner (2007) <doi:10.1016/B978-0-444-53265-7.50015-9>. Abnormal returns are weighted by their statistical precision (i.e., standard deviation), resulting in abnormal standardized returns. This procedure efficiently captures the heteroskedasticity problem. Clustering techniques following Cameron et al. (2011) <doi:10.1198/jbes.2010.07136> are adopted for computing cross-sectional correlation robust standard errors. The statistical tests in this package therefore accounts for potential biases arising from returns' cross-sectional correlation, autocorrelation, and volatility clustering without power loss.",

'revtools' provides interfaces for each of these tasks. An alternative approach, however, is to draw on tools from machine learning to visualise patterns in the corpus. In this case, you can use 'revtools' to render ordinations of text drawn from article titles, keywords and abstracts, and interactively select or exclude individual references, words or topics.",

    "description": "Computing Average and TPX Power under various BHFDR type sequential\nprocedures. All of these procedures involve control of some summary of the\ndistribution of the FDP, e.g. the proportion of discoveries which are false\nin a given experiment. The most widely known of these, the BH-FDR procedure,\ncontrols the FDR which is the mean of the FDP. A lesser known procedure, due\nto Lehmann and Romano, controls the FDX, or probability that the FDP exceeds\na user provided threshold. This is less conservative than FWE control\nprocedures but much more conservative than the BH-FDR proceudre. This\npackage and the references supporting it introduce a new procedure for\ncontrolling the FDX which we call the BH-FDX procedure. This procedure\niteratively identifies, given alpha and lower threshold delta, an alpha*\nless than alpha at which BH-FDR guarantees FDX control.  This uses\nasymptotic approximation and is only slightly more conservative than the\nBH-FDR procedure. Likewise, we can think of the power in multiple testing\nexperiments in terms of a summary of the distribution of the True Positive\nProportion (TPP), the portion of tests truly non-null distributed that are\ncalled significant. The package will compute power, sample size or any other\nmissing parameter required for power defined as (i) the mean of the TPP\n(average power) or (ii) the probability that the TPP exceeds a given value,\nlambda, (TPX power) via asymptotic approximation. All supplied theoretical\nresults are also obtainable via simulation. The suggested approach is to\nnarrow in on a design via the theoretical approaches and then make final\nadjustments/verify the results by simulation. The theoretical results are\ndescribed in Izmirlian, G (2020) Statistics and Probability letters,\n\"<doi:10.1016/j.spl.2020.108713>\", and an applied paper describing the\nmethodology with a simulation study is in preparation.\nSee citation(\"pwrFDR\").",

To address\nthis need, the Neyman-Pearson (NP) classification paradigm is a natural choice;\nit minimizes type II error (i.e., the conditional probability of misclassifying\na class 1 observation as class 0) while enforcing an upper bound, alpha, on the\ntype I error. Although the NP paradigm has a century-long history in hypothesis\ntesting, it has not been well recognized and implemented in classification\nschemes. Common practices that directly limit the empirical type I error to\nno more than alpha do not satisfy the type I error control objective because\nthe resulting classifiers are still likely to have type I errors much larger\nthan alpha. As a result, the NP paradigm has not been properly implemented\nfor many classification scenarios in practice. In this work, we develop the\nfirst umbrella algorithm that implements the NP paradigm for all scoring-type\nclassification methods, including popular methods such as logistic regression,\nsupport vector machines and random forests. Powered by this umbrella algorithm,\nwe propose a novel graphical tool for NP classification methods: NP receiver\noperating characteristic (NP-ROC) bands, motivated by the popular receiver\noperating characteristic (ROC) curves. NP-ROC bands will help choose in a data\nadaptive way and compare different NP classifiers.",

Other explanatory variable such as\nadditional sample measures (e.g. age, height, weight) or batch effects can also\nbe included. For linear mixed models, in addition to the fixed effects of the\ngenotype and the covariates, different random effect components can be included,\naccounting for population structure in the study cohort or environmental\neffects. The application of linear and linear mixed models in quantitative\ngenetics ranges from genetic studies in model organism such as yeast and\n*Arabidopsis thaliana* to human molecular, morphological or imaging derived\ntraits. Developing new methods for increasing numbers of sample cohorts,\nphenotypic measurements or complexity of phenotypes to analyse, often requires\nthe simulation of datasets with a specific underlying phenotype structure.  \n**PhenotypeSimulator** allows for the simulation of complex phenotypes under\ndifferent models, including genetic variant effects and infinitesimal genetic\neffects (reflecting population structure) as well as correlated, non-genetic\ncovariates and observational noise effects. Different phenotypic effects can be\ncombined into a final phenotype while controlling for the proportion of variance\nexplained by each of the components. For each component, the number of\nvariables, their distribution and the design of their effect across traits can\nbe customised. \n",

In prospective studies where the proportion of diseased subjects is an unbiased estimate of the disease prevalence, this package provides several methods for calculating the confidence intervals for PPV and NPV including Clopper-Pearson, Wald, Wilson, Agresti-Coull, and Beta.

A 'fully-sequential space-filling design' means a sequence of nested designs (as the design size varies from one point up to some maximum number of points) with the design points added one at a time and such that the design at each size has good space-filling properties. Two methods target the minimum pairwise distance criterion and generate maximin designs, among which one method is more efficient when design size is large. One method targets the maximum hole size criterion and uses a heuristic to generate what is closer to a minimax design.",

    "description": "A framework for dynamically combining forecasting models for time series forecasting predictive tasks. It leverages machine learning models from other packages to automatically combine expert advice using metalearning and other state-of-the-art forecasting combination approaches. The predictive methods receive a data matrix as input, representing an embedded time series, and return a predictive ensemble model. The ensemble use generic functions 'predict()' and 'forecast()' to forecast future values of the time series. Moreover, an ensemble can be updated using methods, such as 'update_weights()' or 'update_base_models()'. A complete description of the methods can be found in: Cerqueira, V., Torgo, L., Pinto, F., and Soares, C. \"Arbitrated Ensemble for Time Series Forecasting.\" to appear at: Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases.

The second edition includes redesigned graphics and additional chapters. The authors emphasize how to construct and interpret graphs, discuss principles of graphical design, and show how accompanying traditional tabular results are used to confirm the visual impressions derived directly from the graphs. Many of the graphical formats are novel and appear here for the first time in print.  All chapters have exercises.  All functions introduced in the book are in the package.  R code for all examples, both graphs and tables, in the book is included in the scripts directory of the package.",

    "description": "The data volume generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is growing at a pace that is now challenging the storage and data processing capacities of modern computer systems. In this context an important aspect is the reduction of data complexity by collapsing redundant reads in a single cluster to improve the run time, memory requirements, and quality of post-processing steps like assembly. Several alignment-free measures, based on k-mers counts, have been used to cluster reads. Quality scores produced by NGS platforms are fundamental for various analysis of NGS data: reads mapping; error detection; etc. Moreover future-generation sequencing reads promise to contain a large number of erroneous bases (up to 10$\\%$). Thus it will be fundamental to exploit quality value information within the alignment-free framework. We have introduced a family of alignment-free measures, called $D^q$-type, that incorporate quality value information and k-mers counts for the comparison of reads data. A set of experiments on simulated and real reads data confirm that the new measures are superior to other classical alignment-free statistics, especially when erroneous reads are considered. \nWhere dist_type is the distance used for the clustering, num_cluster is the number of partitions in which you want to divide the set of sequences and kmer_length is the length of the words used by the algorithm. The input file (file_fastq) must be in fastq format, as it is defined in Illumina 1.8+ (Phred+33). The program returns on standard output the list of sequences with the number of the corresponding cluster. With the '-w' option the program also outputs the clusters in different files. Use the option '-h' to get the complete list of options. \n",

    "description": "Flow Scheduling is crucial in data centers, as it directly influences user experience of applications. Many flow scheduling solutions leverage priority queues of commodity switches to enforce their scheduling policies. Given the limited number of priority queues, e.g., 8, flow scheduling solutions should choose the most appropriate queue for each outgoing packet. According to different assumptions and design goals, there are four typical flow scheduling problems: SRPT, LAS, Fair Queuing, and Deadline-Aware Scheduling. Most existing works often address one scheduling problem, and seldom handle a key challenge: how to set an appropriate threshold for each queue. This paper unifies the flow scheduling problem as a clustering problem: how to cluster outgoing packets into k queues? To address this problem, we propose a generic framework, namely QCluster, which can address the above challenge. Based on k-means, QCluster clusters packets with the similar weights into the same queue at line rate. For different flow scheduling problems, packet weight has different definitions (e.g., remaining size, bytes sent). QCluster has two key differences with existing works: 1) QCluster is easy to be deployed with two options: only deployed in programmable switches; or only deployed in end hosts. 2) QCluster can automatically adjust the thresholds of queues for each switch at line rate. Experimental results on testbeds with P4Switch and ns-2 show that QCluster achieves comparable or better performance compared with the best algorithm for each scheduling problem. QCluster can reduce the overall average flow completion time (FCT) up to 21.7%, and reduce the average FCT for short flows up to 56.6% over existing solutions.\n",

    "description": "The data volume generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is growing at a pace that is now challenging the storage and data processing capacities of modern computer systems. In this context an important aspect is the reduction of data complexity by collapsing redundant reads in a single cluster to improve the run time, memory requirements, and quality of post-processing steps like assembly. Several alignment-free measures, based on k-mers counts, have been used to cluster reads. Quality scores produced by NGS platforms are fundamental for various analysis of NGS data: reads mapping; error detection; etc. Moreover future-generation sequencing reads promise to contain a large number of erroneous bases (up to 10$\\%$). Thus it will be fundamental to exploit quality value information within the alignment-free framework. We have introduced a family of alignment-free measures, called $D^q$-type, that incorporate quality value information and k-mers counts for the comparison of reads data. A set of experiments on simulated and real reads data confirm that the new measures are superior to other classical alignment-free statistics, especially when erroneous reads are considered. \nWhere dist_type is the distance used for the clustering, num_cluster is the number of partitions in which you want to divide the set of sequences and kmer_length is the length of the words used by the algorithm. The input file (file_fastq) must be in fastq format, as it is defined in Illumina 1.8+ (Phred+33). The program returns on standard output the list of sequences with the number of the corresponding cluster. With the '-w' option the program also outputs the clusters in different files. Use the option '-h' to get the complete list of options. \n",

This method increases computation marginally while significantly enhancing the performance of off-the-shelf models without the need for fine-tuning Additionally, we show how the proposed pattern fits into interactive retrieval design that provides end- users with ongoing updates about the progress of context processing and pinpoints the integration of relevant information into the final response.\n",

The main functionality is contained in the `metric_graph` class, which is used for specifying metric graphs, adding data to them, visualization, and other basic functions that are needed for working with data and random fields on metric graphs. The package also implements various Gaussian fields on metric graphs, and in particular the Whittle--Matérn fields introduced in the references below.  \nBasic statistical tasks such as likelihood evaluation and prediction is implemented for these Gaussian fields in `MetricGraph`. Further, the package also contains interfaces to [R-INLA][ref5] and [inlabru][ref6] that facilitates using those packages for full Bayesian inference of general Latent Gaussian Models (LGMs) that includes Whittle-Matérn fields on metric graphs.  \n",

The encoded data consists only of bytes with values from 0x01 to 0xFF. This is useful for preparing data for\ntransmission over a serial link (RS-232 or RS-485 for example), as the 0 byte can be used to unambiguously indicate packet boundaries. COBS\nalso has the advantage of adding very little overhead (at least 1 byte, plus up to an additional byte per 254 bytes of data). For messages\nsmaller than 254 bytes, the overhead is constant. \nThis is an implementation of COBS for C. It is designed to be both efficient and robust. The code is implemented in modern C99. The decoder\nis designed to detect  malformed input data and report an error upon detection. A test suite is included to validate the encoder and decoder. \n",

Model predictive performance is assessed\nusing mean squared error (MSE), with optional graphical visualization of fold-wise MSEs to support intuitive evaluation of model accuracy.\nThis package is intended to facilitate rigorous model validation in adsorption studies and aid researchers in selecting robust isotherm models.\nFor more details, see Montgomery et al.
