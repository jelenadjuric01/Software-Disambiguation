It also provides functions to generate plots of expected and observed genotype frequencies. Some background on these topics can be found in a recent paper \"Recent advances in conservation and population genomics data analysis\" by Hendricks et al.

In such case, the backward elimination algorithm and the bootstrap restarting iterative segmented quantile algorithm are combined to select the number of change points based on a quantile BIC.

The internal representation is an S4\nclass, which allows us to keep the syntax identical to that of base R's.\nInteraction between floats and base types for binary operators is generally\npossible; in these cases, type promotion always defaults to the higher\nprecision.  The package ships with copies of the single precision 'BLAS' and\n'LAPACK', which are automatically built in the event they are not available\non the system.",

It allows for assessing the consistency of the observed effects, for detecting the presence of potential moderator variables, and for estimating the influence of outlier values on the observed results. For non-significant findings, it can diagnose patterns indicative of underpowered study designs. The p-plot can thus either back the binary accept-vs-reject decision of common null-hypothesis significance tests, or it can qualify this decision and stimulate additional empirical work to arrive at more robust and replicable statistical inferences.",

This package builds upon the 'sigmaNet' package, and users familiar with it will recognize the similar design approach. Two extensions have been added to the classic 'sigma.js' visualizations by overriding the underlying 'JavaScript' code, enabling to draw a frame around node labels, and to display labels on multiple lines by parsing line breaks. Other additional functionalities that did not require overriding 'sigma.js' code include toggling node visibility when clicked using a node attribute and highlighting specific edges.

They achieve this by transforming proximities/distances with explicit power functions and penalizing the fitting criterion with a clusteredness index, the OPTICS Cordillera (Rusch, Hornik & Mair, 2018, <doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1349664>).

These guidelines are usually referred to as APA style (<https://apastyle.apa.org/>) and include specific rules on the formatting of numbers and statistical test results. APA style has to be implemented when submitting scientific reports in a wide range of research fields, especially in the social sciences. The default output of numbers in the R console or R Markdown and Quarto documents does not meet the APA style requirements, and reformatting results manually can be cumbersome and error-prone. This package covers the automatic conversion of R objects to textual representations that meet the APA style requirements, which can be included in R Markdown or Quarto documents. It covers some basic statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, correlation, chi-squared test, Wilcoxon test) as well as some basic number printing manipulations (formatting p-values, removing leading zeros for numbers that cannot be greater than one, and others). Other packages exist for formatting numbers and tests according to the APA style guidelines, such as 'papaja' (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=papaja>) and 'apa' (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=apa>), but they do not offer all convenience functionality included in 'prmisc'. The vignette has an overview of most of the functions included in the package.",

The proposed method can also easily deal with parametric effects of categorical covariates, linear effects of continuous covariates, interactions between categorical and/or continuous covariates, varying coefficient terms, and random effects.

It also allows easy plotting of the\ncorrelation between the smoothed covariate and the outcome as a function of\ntime, which can add additional insights on how to interpret a functional\nregression.  Additionally, it also provides several permutation tests for\nthe significance of the functional predictor.

All single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GWAS are placed in a 'circular genome' according to their location. Then the complete set of SNP association p-values are permuted by rotation with respect to the SNPs' genomic locations. Two testing frameworks are available: permutations at the gene level, and permutations at the SNP level. The permutation at the gene level uses Fisher's combination test to calculate a single gene p-value, followed by the hypergeometric test. The SNP count methodology maps each SNP to pathways/gene-sets and calculates the proportion of SNPs for the real and the permutated datasets above a pre-defined threshold. Genomicper requires a matrix of GWAS association p-values and SNPs annotation to genes. Pathways can be obtained from within the package or can be provided by the user.",

Second, the plot is rotated such that the resulting regression line is vertical, reducing the suggestion that the vertical axis is the dominant one. The slope can be read relative to either axis equally.",

CRSO\nis based on a theoretical model of cancer in which a cancer rule\nis defined to be a collection of two or more events (i.e., alterations) that are minimally\nsufficient to cause cancer. A cancer rule set is a set of cancer rules that collectively\nare assumed to account for all of ways to cause cancer in the population. In CRSO every\nevent is designated explicitly as a passenger or driver within each patient.\nEach event is associated with a patient-specific, event-specific passenger penalty,\nreflecting how unlikely the event would have happened by chance, i.e., as a passenger.\nCRSO evaluates each rule set by assigning all samples to a rule in the rule set,\nor to the null rule, and then calculating the total statistical penalty from all\nunassigned event. CRSO uses a three phase procedure find the best rule set of\nfixed size K for a range of Ks. A core rule set is then identified from among\nthe best rule sets of size K as the rule set that best balances rule set size and\nstatistical penalty.\nUsers should consult the 'crso' vignette for an example walk through of a full CRSO run.\nThe full description, of the CRSO algorithm is presented in:\nKlein MI, Cannataro V, Townsend J, Stern DF and Zhao H. \"Identifying combinations of cancer driver in individual patients.\"\nBioRxiv 674234 [Preprint].

In addition, 'cito' has many downstream functionalities such as various explainable AI (xAI) metrics (e.g. variable importance, partial dependence plots, accumulated local effect plots, and effect estimates) to interpret trained DNNs. 'cito' optionally provides confidence intervals (and p-values) for all xAI metrics and predictions. At the same time, 'cito' is computationally efficient because it is based on the deep learning framework 'torch'. The 'torch' package is native to R, so no Python installation or other API is required for this package.",

Typical uses are the identification of cancer cell origins, validation of cell culture strain identities, validation of single-cell transcriptomes, and validation of identity and purity of flow-sorting and dissection sequencing products.",

The current release: gJLS2, include additional functionalities that enable analyses of X-chromosome genotype data through novel methods for location (Chen et al., 2021; <doi:10.1002/gepi.22422>) and scale (Deng et al., 2019; <doi:10.1002/gepi.22247>).",

        "description": "In silico experimental evolution offers a cost-and-time effective means to test evolutionary hypotheses.  Existing evolutionary simulation tools focus on simulations in a limited experimental framework, and tend to report on only the results presumed of interest by the tools designer.  The R-package for Simulated Haploid Asexual Population Evolution ('rSHAPE') addresses these concerns by implementing a robust simulation framework that outputs complete population demographic and genomic information for in silico evolving communities.  Allowing more than 60 parameters to be specified, 'rSHAPE'\tsimulates evolution across discrete time-steps for an evolving community of haploid asexual populations with binary state genomes.  These settings are for the current state of 'rSHAPE' and future steps will be to increase the breadth of evolutionary conditions permitted.  At present, most effort was placed into permitting varied growth models to be simulated (such as constant size, exponential growth, and logistic growth) as well as various fitness landscape models to reflect the evolutionary landscape (e.g.: Additive, House of Cards - Stuart Kauffman and Simon Levin (1987) <doi:10.1016/S0022-5193(87)80029-2>, NK - Stuart A. Kauffman and Edward D. Weinberger (1989) <doi:10.1016/S0022-5193(89)80019-0>, Rough Mount Fuji - Neidhart, Johannes and Szendro, Ivan G and Krug, Joachim (2014) <doi:10.1534/genetics.114.167668>). This package includes numerous functions though users will only need defineSHAPE(), runSHAPE(), shapeExperiment() and summariseExperiment().  All other functions are called by these main functions and are likely only to be on interest for someone wishing to develop 'rSHAPE'.  Simulation results will be stored in files which are exported to the directory referenced by the shape_workDir option (defaults to tempdir() but do change this by passing a folderpath argument for workDir when calling defineSHAPE() if you plan to make use of your results beyond your current session).  'rSHAPE' will generate numerous replicate simulations for your defined range of experimental parameters.  The experiment will be built under the experimental working directory (i.e.: referenced by the option shape_workDir set using defineSHAPE() ) where individual replicate simulation results will be stored as well as processed results which I have made in an effort to facilitate analyses by automating collection and processing of the potentially thousands of files which will be created. On that note, 'rSHAPE' implements a robust and flexible framework with highly detailed output at the cost of computational efficiency and potentially requiring significant disk space (generally gigabytes but up to tera-bytes for very large simulation efforts).  So, while 'rSHAPE' offers a single framework in which we can simulate evolution and directly compare the impacts of a wide range of parameters, it is not as quick to run as other in silico simulation tools which focus on a single scenario with limited output. There you have it, 'rSHAPE' offers you a less restrictive in silico evolutionary playground than other tools and I hope you enjoy testing your hypotheses.",

The curry package provides three different ways\nof performing partial function application by fixing arguments from either\nend of the argument list (currying and tail currying) or by fixing multiple\nnamed arguments (partial application). This package provides this\nfunctionality through the %<%, %-<%, and %><% operators which allows for\na programming style comparable to modern functional languages. Compared\nto other implementations such a purrr::partial() the operators in curry\ncomposes functions with named arguments, aiding in autocomplete etc.",

A class of methods to correct for selection bias is to apply a statistical model to predict the units not in the sample (super-population modeling). Other studies use calibration or Statistical Matching (statistically match nonprobability and probability samples). To date, the more relevant methods are weighting by Propensity Score Adjustment (PSA).\nThe Propensity Score Adjustment method was originally developed to construct weights by estimating response probabilities and using them in Horvitz–Thompson type estimators. This method is usually used by combining a non-probability sample with a reference sample to construct propensity models for the non-probability sample. Calibration can be used in a posterior way to adding information of auxiliary variables.\nPropensity scores in PSA are usually estimated using logistic regression models. Machine learning classification algorithms can be used as alternatives for logistic regression as a technique to estimate propensities.\nThe package 'NonProbEst' implements some of these methods and thus provides a wide options to work with data coming from a non-probabilistic sample.",

Instead we can retrieve the International Classification of Disease code related to the disease of interest or we can count the occurrence of the Unified Medical Language System. None of them is the true phenotype which needs chart review to identify. However chart review is time consuming and costly. 'PheVis' is an algorithm which is phenotyping (i.e identify a characteristic) at the visit level in an unsupervised fashion. It can be used for chronic or acute diseases. An example of how to use 'PheVis' is available in the vignette. Basically there are two functions that are to be used: `train_phevis()` which trains the algorithm and `test_phevis()` which get the predicted probabilities. The detailed method is described in preprint by Ferté et al. (2020) <doi:10.1101/2020.06.15.20131458>.",

This flexibility enables\nresearchers to tailor enrichment analysis to their specific questions,\nsuch as identifying enriched transcriptional regulators in gene expression\ndata or overrepresented protein domains in protein sets. To facilitate\nseamless analysis, mulea provides gene sets (in standardised GMT format)\nfor 27 model organisms, covering 22 ontology types from 16 databases and\nvarious identifiers resulting in almost 900 files. Additionally, the\nmuleaData ExperimentData Bioconductor package simplifies access to these\npre-defined ontologies. Finally, mulea's architecture allows for easy\nintegration of user-defined ontologies, or GMT files from external\nsources (e.g., MSigDB or Enrichr), expanding its applicability across\ndiverse research areas. Conclusions - mulea is distributed as a CRAN R\npackage. It offers researchers a powerful and flexible toolkit for\nfunctional enrichment analysis, addressing limitations of traditional\ntools with its progressive eFDR and by supporting a variety of ontologies.\nOverall, mulea fosters the exploration of diverse biological questions\nacross various model organisms.",

Four multiple imputation methods are proposed, two are based on joint modelling and two are fully sequential methods, as discussed in  Audigier et al. (2021) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2106.04424>. II) cluster analysis of imputed data sets. Six clustering methods are available (distances-based or model-based), but custom methods can also be easily used. III) Partition pooling. The set of partitions is aggregated using Non-negative Matrix Factorization based method. An associated instability measure is computed by bootstrap (see Fang, Y. and Wang, J., 2012 <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2011.09.003>). Among applications, this instability measure can be used to choose a number of clusters with missing values.\nThe package also proposes several diagnostic tools to tune the number of imputed data sets, to tune the number of iterations in fully sequential imputation, to check the fit of imputation models, etc.",

        "description": "Fit multiclass Classification version of Bayesian Adaptive Smoothing Splines (CBASS) to data using reversible jump MCMC. The multiclass classification problem consists of a response variable that takes on unordered categorical values with at least three levels, and a set of inputs for each response variable. The CBASS model consists of a latent multivariate probit formulation, and the means of the latent Gaussian random variables are specified using adaptive regression splines. The MCMC alternates updates of the latent Gaussian variables and the spline parameters. All the spline parameters (variables, signs, knots, number of interactions), including the number of basis functions used to model each latent mean, are inferred. Functions are provided to process inputs, initialize the chain, run the chain, and make predictions. Predictions are made on a probabilistic basis, where, for a given input, the probabilities of each categorical value are produced. See Marrs and Francom (2023) \"Multiclass classification using Bayesian multivariate adaptive regression splines\" Under review.",

DBS is able to adapt itself to structures of high-dimensional data such as natural clusters characterized by distance and/or density based structures in the data space. The first module is the parameter-free projection method called Pswarm (Pswarm()), which exploits the concepts of self-organization and emergence, game theory, swarm intelligence and symmetry considerations. The second module is the parameter-free high-dimensional data visualization technique, which generates projected points on the topographic map with hypsometric tints defined by the generalized U-matrix (GeneratePswarmVisualization()). The third module is the clustering method itself with non-critical parameters (DBSclustering()). Clustering can be verified by the visualization and vice versa. The term DBS refers to the method as a whole. It enables even a non-professional in the field of data mining to apply its algorithms for visualization and/or clustering to data sets with completely different structures drawn from diverse research fields. The comparison to common projection methods can be found in the book of Thrun, M.C.: \"Projection Based Clustering through Self-Organization and Swarm Intelligence\" (2018) <DOI:10.1007/978-3-658-20540-9>.",

        "description": "Simulate multivariate correlated data given nonparametric marginals and their joint structure characterized by a Pearson or Spearman correlation matrix. The simulator engages the problem from a purely computational perspective. It assumes no statistical models such as copulas or parametric distributions, and can approximate the target correlations regardless of theoretical feasibility. The algorithm integrates and advances the Iman-Conover (1982) approach <doi:10.1080/03610918208812265> and the Ruscio-Kaczetow iteration (2008) <doi:10.1080/00273170802285693>. Package functions are carefully implemented in C++ for squeezing computing speed, suitable for large input in a manycore environment. Precision of the approximation and computing speed both substantially outperform various CRAN packages to date. Benchmarks are detailed in function examples. A simple heuristic algorithm is additionally designed to optimize the joint distribution in the post-simulation stage. The heuristic demonstrated good potential of achieving the same level of precision of approximation without the enhanced Iman-Conover-Ruscio-Kaczetow. The package contains a copy of Permuted Congruential Generator.",

(2022) <arXiv:2211.08661v1>. The model uses the concept of Self Exciting Threshold Autoregressive (SETAR) models to define the node splits and thus, the model is named SETAR-Tree. The SETAR-Tree uses some time-series-specific splitting and stopping procedures. It trains global pooled regression models in the leaves allowing the models to learn cross-series information. The depth of the tree is controlled by conducting a statistical linearity test as well as measuring the error reduction percentage at each node split. Thus, the SETAR-Tree requires minimal external hyperparameter tuning and provides competitive results under its default configuration. A forest is developed by extending the SETAR-Tree. The SETAR-Forest combines the forecasts provided by a collection of diverse SETAR-Trees during the forecasting process.",

Given one or more risk prediction instruments (risk models) that estimate the probability of a binary outcome, rmda provides functions to estimate and display decision curves and other figures that help assess the population impact of using a risk model for clinical decision making.   Here, \"population\" refers to the relevant patient population. Decision curves display estimates of the (standardized) net benefit over a range of probability thresholds used to categorize observations as 'high risk'. The curves help evaluate a treatment policy that recommends treatment for patients who are estimated to be 'high risk' by comparing the population impact of a risk-based policy to \"treat all\" and \"treat none\" intervention policies.  Curves can be estimated using data from a prospective cohort.  In addition, rmda can estimate decision curves using data from a case-control study if an estimate of the population outcome prevalence is available.  Version 1.4 of the package provides an alternative framing of the decision problem for situations where treatment is the standard-of-care and a risk model might be used to recommend that low-risk patients (i.e., patients below some risk threshold) opt out of treatment. Confidence intervals calculated using the bootstrap can be computed and displayed. A wrapper function to calculate cross-validated curves using k-fold cross-validation is also provided.",

The user simply provides the data, and answers a few questions (for example, how many times would you like to resample the data).\nFrom there the package randomly splits the data into train, test and validation sets, builds models on the training data, makes predictions on the test and validation sets,\nmeasures root mean squared error (RMSE), removes features above a user-set level of Variance Inflation Factor, and has several optional features including scaling\nall numeric data, four different ways to handle strings in the data. Perhaps the most significant feature is the package's ability to make predictions\nusing the 40 pre trained models on totally new (untrained) data if the user selects that feature. This feature alone represents a very effective solution\nto the issue of reproducibility of models in data science. The package can also randomly resample the data as many times as the user sets, thus giving more\naccurate results than a single run. The graphs provide many results that are not typically found. For example, the package automatically calculates the Kolmogorov-Smirnov\ntest for each of the 40 models and plots a bar chart of the results, a bias bar chart of each of the 40 models, as well as several plots for exploratory data\nanalysis (automatic histograms of the numeric data, automatic histograms of the numeric data). The package also automatically creates a summary report\nthat can be both sorted and searched for each of the 40 models, including RMSE, bias, train RMSE, test RMSE, validation RMSE, overfitting and duration.\nThe best results on the holdout data typically beat the best results in data science competitions and published results for the same data set.",

In fact, under the common priors for the variance, useful quantities in the original data scale (like mean and quantiles) do not have posterior moments that are finite (Fabrizi et al. 2012 <doi:10.1214/12-BA733>). This package allows to easily carry out a proper Bayesian inferential procedure by fixing a suitable distribution (the generalized inverse Gaussian) as prior for the variance. Functions to estimate several kind of means (unconditional, conditional and conditional under a mixed model) and quantiles (unconditional and conditional) are provided.",

Valid allocations must satisfy no-subsidy constraints,\nmeaning that no group of agents contributes more than the highest cost of\nits members (i.e., no agent is allowed to subsidize another). A rule is a\nmechanism that selects an allocation vector for a given problem. This\npackage computes several rules proposed in the literature, including both\nstandard rules and their variants, such as weighted versions, rules for\nclones, and rules based on the agents’ hierarchy order. These rules can be\napplied to various problems of interest, including the allocation of\nliabilities and the maintenance of irrigation systems, among others.\nMoreover, the package provides functions for graphical representation,\nenabling users to visually compare the outcomes produced by each rule,\nor to display the no-subsidy set. In addition, it includes four datasets\nillustrating different applications and examples of airport problems. For a\nmore detailed explanation of all concepts, see Thomson (2024)\n<doi:10.1016/j.mathsocsci.2024.03.007>.",

Given one or more risk prediction instruments (risk models) that estimate the probability of a binary outcome, rmda provides functions to estimate and display decision curves and other figures that help assess the population impact of using a risk model for clinical decision making.   Here, \"population\" refers to the relevant patient population. Decision curves display estimates of the (standardized) net benefit over a range of probability thresholds used to categorize observations as 'high risk'. The curves help evaluate a treatment policy that recommends treatment for patients who are estimated to be 'high risk' by comparing the population impact of a risk-based policy to \"treat all\" and \"treat none\" intervention policies.  Curves can be estimated using data from a prospective cohort.  In addition, rmda can estimate decision curves using data from a case-control study if an estimate of the population outcome prevalence is available.  Version 1.4 of the package provides an alternative framing of the decision problem for situations where treatment is the standard-of-care and a risk model might be used to recommend that low-risk patients (i.e., patients below some risk threshold) opt out of treatment. Confidence intervals calculated using the bootstrap can be computed and displayed. A wrapper function to calculate cross-validated curves using k-fold cross-validation is also provided.",

(i) For sampling at one time point, simulations are performed under a constant rate birth-death process, conditioned on having a fixed number of final tips (sim.bd.taxa()), or a fixed age (sim.bd.age()), or a fixed age and number of tips (sim.bd.taxa.age()). When conditioning on the number of final tips, the method allows for shifts in rates and mass extinction events during the birth-death process (sim.rateshift.taxa()). The function sim.bd.age() (and sim.rateshift.taxa() without extinction) allow the speciation rate to change in a density-dependent way. The LTT plots of the simulations can be displayed using LTT.plot(), LTT.plot.gen() and LTT.average.root(). TreeSim further samples trees with n final tips from a set of trees generated by the common sampling algorithm stopping when a fixed number m>>n of tips is first reached (sim.gsa.taxa()). This latter method is appropriate for m-tip trees generated under a big class of models (details in the sim.gsa.taxa() man page). For incomplete phylogeny, the missing speciation events can be added through simulations (corsim()). (ii) sim.rateshifts.taxa() is generalized to sim.bdsky.stt() for serially sampled trees, where the trees are conditioned on either the number of sampled tips or the age. Furthermore, for a multitype-branching process with sequential sampling, trees on a fixed number of tips can be simulated using sim.bdtypes.stt.taxa(). This function further allows to simulate under epidemiological models with an exposed class. The function sim.genespeciestree() simulates coalescent gene trees within birth-death species trees, and sim.genetree() simulates coalescent gene trees.",

For 'MS Word', the msWord() function uses the\n'flextable' package to construct 'Word' tables which include the\ngraphs.  There are several distinct approaches for constructing HTML\nfiles.  The simplest is to use the msWord() function with argument\nfiletype=\"html\".  Alternatively, use either 'Emacs org-mode' or the\nhtmlTable::htmlTable() function to construct an 'HTML' file\ncontaining tables which include the graphs.  See the documentation\nfor our as.htmlimg() function.  For 'Excel' use on 'Windows', the\nfile examples/irisExcel.xls includes 'VBA' code which brings the\nindividual panels into individual cells in the spreadsheet.\nExamples in the examples and demo subdirectories are shown with\n'lattice' graphics, 'ggplot2' graphics, and 'base' graphics.\nExamples for 'LaTeX' include 'Sweave' (both 'LaTeX'-style and\n'Noweb'-style), 'knitr', 'emacs org-mode', and 'rmarkdown' input\nfiles and their 'pdf' output files.  Examples for 'HTML' include\n'org-mode' and 'Rmd' input files and their webarchive 'HTML' output\nfiles.  In addition, the as.orgtable() function can display a\ndata.frame in an 'org-mode' document.

However, the main focus of hydroPSO is the calibration of environmental and other real-world models that need to be executed from the system console. hydroPSO is model-independent, allowing the user to easily interface any computer simulation model with the calibration engine (PSO). hydroPSO  communicates with the model through the model's own input and output files, without requiring access to the model's source code. Several PSO variants and controlling options are included to fine-tune the performance of the calibration engine to different calibration problems. An advanced sensitivity analysis function together with user-friendly plotting summaries facilitate the interpretation and assessment of the calibration results. hydroPSO is parallel-capable, to alleviate the computational burden of complex models with \"long\" execution time. Bugs reports/comments/questions are very welcomed (in English, Spanish or Italian). See Zambrano-Bigiarini and Rojas (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2013.01.004> for more details.",

(2009). The common information shared by all the variables is modeled by a factor analysis structure. The number of factors considered in the model is chosen to reduce the false discoveries variance in multiple tests. The model parameters are estimated thanks to an EM algorithm. Adjusted tests statistics are derived, as well as the associated p-values. The proportion of true null hypotheses (an important parameter when controlling the false discovery rate) is also estimated from the FAMT model. Graphics are proposed to interpret and describe the factors.",

The main functions are correct.RS() for correcting for response styles, and ccrs() for simultaneously correcting and content-based clustering. The procedure begin with making rank-ordered boundary data from the given preference matrix using a function called create.ccrsdata(). Then in correct.RS(), the response style is corrected as follows: the rank-ordered boundary data are smoothed by I-spline functions, the given preference data are transformed by the smoothed functions. The resulting data matrix, which is considered as bias-corrected data, can be used for any data analysis methods. If one wants to cluster respondents based on their indicated preferences (content-based clustering), ccrs() can be applied to the given (response-style-biased) preference data, which simultaneously corrects for response styles and clusters respondents based on the contents. Also, the correction result can be checked by plot.crs() function.",

In first step, the method tests for an overall marginal genetic association between the genetic variant and the multivariate phenotype. The genetic variants which show an evidence of marginal overall genetic effect in the first step are prioritized while testing for an overall gene-environment interaction effect in the second step.

The first stage of a synthesis process (such as a systematic review or meta-analysis) is to download a list of references from academic search engines such as 'Web of Knowledge' or 'Scopus'. The traditional approach to systematic review is then to sort these data manually, first by locating and removing duplicated entries, and then screening to remove irrelevant content by viewing titles and abstracts (in that order). 'revtools' provides interfaces for each of these tasks. An alternative approach, however, is to draw on tools from machine learning to visualise patterns in the corpus. In this case, you can use 'revtools' to render ordinations of text drawn from article titles, keywords and abstracts, and interactively select or exclude individual references, words or topics.",

All of these procedures involve control of some summary of the\ndistribution of the FDP, e.g. the proportion of discoveries which are false\nin a given experiment. The most widely known of these, the BH-FDR procedure,\ncontrols the FDR which is the mean of the FDP. A lesser known procedure, due\nto Lehmann and Romano, controls the FDX, or probability that the FDP exceeds\na user provided threshold. This is less conservative than FWE control\nprocedures but much more conservative than the BH-FDR proceudre. This\npackage and the references supporting it introduce a new procedure for\ncontrolling the FDX which we call the BH-FDX procedure. This procedure\niteratively identifies, given alpha and lower threshold delta, an alpha*\nless than alpha at which BH-FDR guarantees FDX control.  This uses\nasymptotic approximation and is only slightly more conservative than the\nBH-FDR procedure. Likewise, we can think of the power in multiple testing\nexperiments in terms of a summary of the distribution of the True Positive\nProportion (TPP), the portion of tests truly non-null distributed that are\ncalled significant. The package will compute power, sample size or any other\nmissing parameter required for power defined as (i) the mean of the TPP\n(average power) or (ii) the probability that the TPP exceeds a given value,\nlambda, (TPX power) via asymptotic approximation. All supplied theoretical\nresults are also obtainable via simulation. The suggested approach is to\nnarrow in on a design via the theoretical approaches and then make final\nadjustments/verify the results by simulation. The theoretical results are\ndescribed in Izmirlian, G (2020) Statistics and Probability letters,\n\"<doi:10.1016/j.spl.2020.108713>\", and an applied paper describing the\nmethodology with a simulation study is in preparation.\nSee citation(\"pwrFDR\").",

        "description": "In many binary classification applications, such as disease\ndiagnosis and spam detection, practitioners commonly face the need to limit\ntype I error (i.e., the conditional probability of misclassifying a class 0\nobservation as class 1) so that it remains below a desired threshold. To address\nthis need, the Neyman-Pearson (NP) classification paradigm is a natural choice;\nit minimizes type II error (i.e., the conditional probability of misclassifying\na class 1 observation as class 0) while enforcing an upper bound, alpha, on the\ntype I error. Although the NP paradigm has a century-long history in hypothesis\ntesting, it has not been well recognized and implemented in classification\nschemes. Common practices that directly limit the empirical type I error to\nno more than alpha do not satisfy the type I error control objective because\nthe resulting classifiers are still likely to have type I errors much larger\nthan alpha. As a result, the NP paradigm has not been properly implemented\nfor many classification scenarios in practice. In this work, we develop the\nfirst umbrella algorithm that implements the NP paradigm for all scoring-type\nclassification methods, including popular methods such as logistic regression,\nsupport vector machines and random forests. Powered by this umbrella algorithm,\nwe propose a novel graphical tool for NP classification methods: NP receiver\noperating characteristic (NP-ROC) bands, motivated by the popular receiver\noperating characteristic (ROC) curves. NP-ROC bands will help choose in a data\nadaptive way and compare different NP classifiers.",
