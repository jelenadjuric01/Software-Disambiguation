        "description": "Flow Scheduling is crucial in data centers, as it directly influences user experience of applications. Many flow scheduling solutions leverage priority queues of commodity switches to enforce their scheduling policies. Given the limited number of priority queues, e.g., 8, flow scheduling solutions should choose the most appropriate queue for each outgoing packet. According to different assumptions and design goals, there are four typical flow scheduling problems: SRPT, LAS, Fair Queuing, and Deadline-Aware Scheduling. Most existing works often address one scheduling problem, and seldom handle a key challenge: how to set an appropriate threshold for each queue. This paper unifies the flow scheduling problem as a clustering problem: how to cluster outgoing packets into k queues? To address this problem, we propose a generic framework, namely QCluster, which can address the above challenge. Based on k-means, QCluster clusters packets with the similar weights into the same queue at line rate. For different flow scheduling problems, packet weight has different definitions (e.g., remaining size, bytes sent). QCluster has two key differences with existing works: 1) QCluster is easy to be deployed with two options: only deployed in programmable switches; or only deployed in end hosts. 2) QCluster can automatically adjust the thresholds of queues for each switch at line rate. Experimental results on testbeds with P4Switch and ns-2 show that QCluster achieves comparable or better performance compared with the best algorithm for each scheduling problem. QCluster can reduce the overall average flow completion time (FCT) up to 21.7%, and reduce the average FCT for short flows up to 56.6% over existing solutions.\n",

The rWHALE backend software runs these different\napplications for the user, taking the outputs from some programs and\nproviding them as inputs to others. The design of the R2D\napplication is such that researchers are able to modify the backend\napplications to utilize their own application in the workflow\ncomputations. This will ensure researchers are not limited to using\nthe default applications we provide and will be enthused to provide\ntheir own applications for others to use. \nThis application is under active development. Researchers are encouraged to comment on what additional\nfeatures and applications they would like to see in this\napplication. If you want it, chances are many of your colleagues also\nwould benefit from it. \n",

        "description": "[Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing) is an encoding that removes all 0 bytes\nfrom arbitrary binary data. The encoded data consists only of bytes with values from 0x01 to 0xFF. This is useful for preparing data for\ntransmission over a serial link (RS-232 or RS-485 for example), as the 0 byte can be used to unambiguously indicate packet boundaries. COBS\nalso has the advantage of adding very little overhead (at least 1 byte, plus up to an additional byte per 254 bytes of data). For messages\nsmaller than 254 bytes, the overhead is constant. \nThis is an implementation of COBS for C. It is designed to be both efficient and robust. The code is implemented in modern C99. The decoder\nis designed to detect  malformed input data and report an error upon detection. A test suite is included to validate the encoder and decoder. \n",

In this context an important aspect is the reduction of data complexity by collapsing redundant reads in a single cluster to improve the run time, memory requirements, and quality of post-processing steps like assembly. Several alignment-free measures, based on k-mers counts, have been used to cluster reads. Quality scores produced by NGS platforms are fundamental for various analysis of NGS data: reads mapping; error detection; etc. Moreover future-generation sequencing reads promise to contain a large number of erroneous bases (up to 10$\\%$). Thus it will be fundamental to exploit quality value information within the alignment-free framework. We have introduced a family of alignment-free measures, called $D^q$-type, that incorporate quality value information and k-mers counts for the comparison of reads data. A set of experiments on simulated and real reads data confirm that the new measures are superior to other classical alignment-free statistics, especially when erroneous reads are considered. \nWhere dist_type is the distance used for the clustering, num_cluster is the number of partitions in which you want to divide the set of sequences and kmer_length is the length of the words used by the algorithm. The input file (file_fastq) must be in fastq format, as it is defined in Illumina 1.8+ (Phred+33). The program returns on standard output the list of sequences with the number of the corresponding cluster. With the '-w' option the program also outputs the clusters in different files. Use the option '-h' to get the complete list of options. \n",

        "description": "The data volume generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is growing at a pace that is now challenging the storage and data processing capacities of modern computer systems. In this context an important aspect is the reduction of data complexity by collapsing redundant reads in a single cluster to improve the run time, memory requirements, and quality of post-processing steps like assembly. Several alignment-free measures, based on k-mers counts, have been used to cluster reads. Quality scores produced by NGS platforms are fundamental for various analysis of NGS data: reads mapping; error detection; etc. Moreover future-generation sequencing reads promise to contain a large number of erroneous bases (up to 10$\\%$). Thus it will be fundamental to exploit quality value information within the alignment-free framework. We have introduced a family of alignment-free measures, called $D^q$-type, that incorporate quality value information and k-mers counts for the comparison of reads data. A set of experiments on simulated and real reads data confirm that the new measures are superior to other classical alignment-free statistics, especially when erroneous reads are considered. \nWhere dist_type is the distance used for the clustering, num_cluster is the number of partitions in which you want to divide the set of sequences and kmer_length is the length of the words used by the algorithm. The input file (file_fastq) must be in fastq format, as it is defined in Illumina 1.8+ (Phred+33). The program returns on standard output the list of sequences with the number of the corresponding cluster. With the '-w' option the program also outputs the clusters in different files. Use the option '-h' to get the complete list of options. \n",

It implements a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler using 'Rcpp' to compute a Bayesian estimate of what we call the heterozygote miscall rate for restriction-associated digest (RAD) sequencing data and other types of reduced representation GBS data. It also provides functions to generate plots of expected and observed genotype frequencies. Some background on these topics can be found in a recent paper \"Recent advances in conservation and population genomics data analysis\" by Hendricks et al.

The amount of information required and the format of the results, however, imposes a large extra workload at the end of studies on clinical trial units. In particular, the adverse-event-reporting component requires entering: each unique combination of treatment group and safety event; for every such event above, a further 4 pieces of information (body system, number of occurrences, number of subjects, number exposed) for non-serious events, plus an extra three pieces of data for serious adverse events (numbers of causally related events, deaths, causally related deaths). This package prepares the required statistics needed by EudraCT and formats them into the precise requirements to directly upload an XML file into the web portal, with no further data entry by hand.",

Then, all the markers that are potentially associated with the trait are included in a multi-locus genetic model, their effects are estimated by empirical Bayes, and all the nonzero effects were further identified by likelihood ratio test for significant QTL. The program may run on a desktop or laptop computers. If marker genotypes in association mapping population are almost homozygous, these methods in this software are very effective. If there are many heterozygous marker genotypes, the IIIVmrMLM software is recommended.

While several 'R' packages have been developed to interface 'sigma.js', all were developed for v1.x.x and none have migrated to v2.4.0 nor are they planning to. This package builds upon the 'sigmaNet' package, and users familiar with it will recognize the similar design approach. Two extensions have been added to the classic 'sigma.js' visualizations by overriding the underlying 'JavaScript' code, enabling to draw a frame around node labels, and to display labels on multiple lines by parsing line breaks. Other additional functionalities that did not require overriding 'sigma.js' code include toggling node visibility when clicked using a node attribute and highlighting specific edges. 'sigma.js' is currently preparing a stable release v3.0.0, and this package plans to update to it when it is available.",

They achieve this by transforming proximities/distances with explicit power functions and penalizing the fitting criterion with a clusteredness index, the OPTICS Cordillera (Rusch, Hornik & Mair, 2018, <doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1349664>). There are two variants: One for finding the configuration directly (COPS-C) with given explicit power transformations and implicit ratio, interval and non-metric optimal scaling transformations (Borg & Groenen, 2005, ISBN:978-0-387-28981-6), and one for using the augmented fitting criterion to find optimal hyperparameters for the explicit transformations (P-COPS). The package contains various functions, wrappers, methods and classes for fitting, plotting and displaying a large number of different MDS models (most of the functionality in smacofx) in the COPS framework. The package further contains a function for pattern search optimization, the ``Adaptive Luus-Jaakola Algorithm'' (Rusch, Mair & Hornik, 2021,<doi:10.1080/10618600.2020.1869027>) and a functions to calculate the phi-distances for count data or histograms.",

Linear problems are solved by\ndense QR decomposition from 'LAPACK' which can limit the size of\ntreated problems. On the other side, we avoid condition number\ndegradation which happens in classical quadratic programming approach.\nInequality constraints treatment on each non\nlinear iteration is based on 'NNLS' method (by Lawson and Hanson).\nWe provide an original function 'lsi_ln' for solving linear least squares\nproblem with inequality constraints in least norm sens. Thus if Jacobian of\nthe problem is rank deficient a solution still can be provided.\nHowever, truncation errors are probable in this case.\nEquality constraints are treated by using a basis of Null-space.\nUser defined function calculating residuals must return a list having\nresidual vector (not their squared sum) and Jacobian. If Jacobian is\nnot in the returned list, package 'numDeriv' is used to calculated\nfinite difference version of Jacobian. The 'NLSIC' method was fist\npublished in Sokol et al.

The\napproach generally follows the ideas of Goldsmith, Bobb, Crainiceanu,\nCaffo, and Reich (2011)<DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.10007> and the approach taken in their sample code, but\nwith some modifications to make it more feasible to use with long rather\nthan wide, non-rectangular longitudinal datasets with unequal and\npotentially random measurement times.  It also allows easy plotting of the\ncorrelation between the smoothed covariate and the outcome as a function of\ntime, which can add additional insights on how to interpret a functional\nregression.  Additionally, it also provides several permutation tests for\nthe significance of the functional predictor.  The heuristic interpretation\nof ``time'' is used to describe the index of the functional predictor, but\nthe same methods can equally be used for another unidimensional continuous\nindex, such as space along a north-south axis.  Note that most of the functionality\nof this package has been superseded by added features after 2016 in the 'pfr' function by\nJonathan Gellar, Mathew W. McLean, Jeff Goldsmith, and Fabian Scheipl, in the\n'refund' package built by Jeff Goldsmith and co-authors and maintained by Julia Wrobel.\nThe development of the funreg package in 2015 and 2016 was part of a research\nproject supported by Award R03 CA171809-01 from the National Cancer Institute and Award P50\nDA010075 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

The numbers of marker alleles in extreme low and high pools are used in existing methods to identify trait-related genes, while the numbers of marker alleles and genotypes in extreme low and high pools are used in the new methods to construct a new statistic Gw for identifying trait-related genes. dQTG-seq2 is feasible to identify extremely over-dominant and small-effect genes in F2.
