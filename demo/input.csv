1;(STAR;10.1038/s41598-021-86032-5;Then, the high-quality reads were aligned to the reference genome (hg19) using Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) with the parameter –quantMode GeneCounts for gene-level quantification and otherwise default parameters
2;(STAR;10.3389/fphys.2020.623190;Next, the two reads per sample (R1 and R2) were mapped to the mouse reference genome (build GRCm38/mm10) using Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR version 2.6.1) (Dobin et al., 2013)
3;ABBYY;10.1109/JTEHM.2019.2935451;A 4-sample test for equality of proportions showed that the overall successful search rate differed significantly between the OCR engines (, df = 3, p < 0.001), with ML Kit and Rekognition having a significantly higher overall success rate than Azure OCR and ABBYY RTR (p < 0.001 for all multiple pairwise comparison with Bonferroni correction)
4;BCEA;10.1371/journal.pntd.0008521;We used the BCEA package in the software R 3.6.1 for the analysis [23].
