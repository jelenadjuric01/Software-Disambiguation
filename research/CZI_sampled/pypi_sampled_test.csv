Axe;https://pypi.org/project/Axe,https://github.com/soasme/axe;10.1186/s12859-021-04267-5;Axe uses a set of pre-computed prefix trees to find a match within a given Hamming distance and can partially handle barcodes that differ in length

Axe;https://pypi.org/project/Axe,https://github.com/soasme/axe;10.7717/peerj.7170;"Popular tools include FASTX-Toolkit (Gordon & Hannon, 2010), Axe (Murray & Borevitz, 2018), Flexbar (Dodt et al., 2012; Roehr, Dieterich & Reinert, 2017), Cutadapt (Martin, 2011), and AdapterRemoval (Lindgreen, 2012; Schubert, Lindgreen & Orlando, 2016), Trimmomatic (Bolger, Lohse & Usadel, 2014), Skewer (Jiang et al., 2014), and GBSX (Herten et al., 2015)"
Axe;https://pypi.org/project/Axe,https://github.com/soasme/axe;10.3390/genes10010009;Paired-end reads were demultiplexed and barcodes were trimmed using Axe [79] with a maximum mismatch of 1
ecopy;https://pypi.org/project/ecopy,https://github.com/Auerilas/ecopy;10.1186/s12915-020-00804-5;We then used this information to generate a Bray-Curtis distance matrix using the ecopy package in Python
ecopy;https://pypi.org/project/ecopy,https://github.com/Auerilas/ecopy;10.1002/ece3.7299;The abundances were square‐root transformed (to match the transformation of the abundance matrix used in the Bray–Curtis calculation), and the analysis was conducted in Python using ecopy's simper function.
ecopy;https://pypi.org/project/ecopy,https://github.com/Auerilas/ecopy;10.3389/fmicb.2020.01847;Richness and Good’s coverage for the Phaeocystis assemblage was calculated with 100 permutations using the “ecopy” (Lemoine, 2015) and “scikit-bio” packages on Python 3.6.1
ecopy;https://pypi.org/project/ecopy,https://github.com/Auerilas/ecopy;10.1128/mBio.00521-21;We then used this matrix to compute distance metrics between each genome based on protein content using the ecopy package in Python (method=‘jaccard’, transform=‘1’) and performing a principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) using the skbio package
libensemble;https://pypi.org/project/libensemble,https://github.com/Libensemble/libensemble;10.1208/s12248-020-00471-y;The implementation of a multi-start algorithm (24) such as libensemble (25) may be a possible extension for the presented research to overcome these challenges
stringdb;https://pypi.org/project/stringdb,https://github.com/gpp-rnd/stringdb;10.1186/s12920-017-0245-6;KEGG, GO, and PPI enrichments for the gene groups were obtained using the stringdb package in R [16, 17]
stringdb;https://pypi.org/project/stringdb,https://github.com/gpp-rnd/stringdb;10.3390/biomedicines9070795;(a) The PPI network of identified menin’s interactome was constructed by stringdb websever
stringdb;https://pypi.org/project/stringdb,https://github.com/gpp-rnd/stringdb;10.1371/journal.pone.0199461;Protein–protein (PP) interactions including physical and functional association across our set of genes were identified in stringdb 10.0 [45]
WeBIAS;https://pypi.org/project/WeBIAS;10.1186/s13104-015-1622-x;Although these features make WeBIAS useful in complex environments, it can be very easily deployed on a single server
WeBIAS;https://pypi.org/project/WeBIAS;10.1186/s13321-020-0408-x;In efforts to facilitate easier dissemination of bioinformatic applications as web server, Daniluk et al. [278] introduced the WeBIAS platform, which is a self-contained solution that helps to make command-line programs accessible via web forms
WeBIAS;https://pypi.org/project/WeBIAS;10.1186/s13104-015-1622-x;WeBIAS manages its own user authentication and authorization
WeBIAS;https://pypi.org/project/WeBIAS;10.1186/s13104-015-1622-x;Nevertheless, they usually have a usable application, which can be easily adapted for WeBIAS.
WeBIAS;https://pypi.org/project/WeBIAS;10.1186/s13104-015-1622-x;WeBIAS uses its database to store these
plottools;https://pypi.org/project/plottools,https://github.com/BrechtBa/plottools;10.1186/1752-0509-3-109;Data was retrieved from the UCSC DAS server using DASMiner API, and the plot can be easily prepared using plottools, a GUI tool to make graphics in Matlab (see file Fig4B_histonesPlots_CancervsNormal.fig in the examples folder of the distributed source code)
Imagery;https://pypi.org/project/Imagery,https://github.com/prakashclt;10.1371/journal.pone.0218378;Then, they were asked to imagine the same different types of walking accompanied by a simultaneous stepping in place performed with a posture and a manner both coherent with the actual execution of that movement (dynamic Motor Imagery, dMI)
Imagery;https://pypi.org/project/Imagery,https://github.com/prakashclt;10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00360;Imagery does not add any new basic elements (e.g., a light tower) but computes, for example, second order aspects such as path lengths
Imagery;https://pypi.org/project/Imagery,https://github.com/prakashclt;10.1371/journal.pone.0163407;DNR GPS), and the Google Earth and Landsat Imagery are freely accessible they provide ideal tools for citizen science-based projects.
