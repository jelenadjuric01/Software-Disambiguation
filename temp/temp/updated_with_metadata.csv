It incorporates expert, up-to-date methodology to help researchers choose the most appropriate analysis approach when some data are missing. You provide the available data and the assumed causal structure, including the likely causes of missing data. 'midoc' will advise which analysis approaches can be used, and how best to perform them. 'midoc' follows the framework for the treatment and reporting of missing data in observational studies (TARMOS). Lee et al (2021). <doi:10.1016/j.jclinepi.2021.01.008>.",R

Three main features are provided: functions for generating document thumbnails, functions for performing visual tests of documents and a function for updating fields and table of contents of a 'Microsoft Word' or 'RTF' document. In order to work, 'LibreOffice' must be installed on the machine and or 'Microsoft Word'. If the latter is available, it can be used to produce PDF documents or images identical to the originals; otherwise, 'LibreOffice' is used and the rendering can be sometimes different from the original documents.",R
