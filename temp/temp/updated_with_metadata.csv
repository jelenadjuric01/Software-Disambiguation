In prospective studies where the proportion of diseased subjects is an unbiased estimate of the disease prevalence, this package provides several methods for calculating the confidence intervals for PPV and NPV including Clopper-Pearson, Wald, Wilson, Agresti-Coull, and Beta.

The solvers differ from the mainstream in the options of (i) restricting subset size, (ii) bounding subset elements, (iii) mining real-value multisets with predefined subset sum errors, (iv) finding one or more subsets in limited time. A novel algorithm for mining the one-dimensional Subset Sum induced algorithms for the multi-Subset Sum and the multidimensional Subset Sum. The multi-threaded framework for the latter offers exact algorithms to the multidimensional Knapsack and the Generalized Assignment problems. Historical updates include (a) renewed implementation of the multi-Subset Sum, multidimensional Knapsack and Generalized Assignment solvers; (b) availability of bounding solution space in the multidimensional Subset Sum; (c) fundamental data structure and architectural changes for enhanced cache locality and better chance of SIMD vectorization; (d) option of mapping floating-point instance to compressed 64-bit integer instance with user-controlled precision loss, which could yield substantial speedup due to the dimension reduction and efficient compressed integer arithmetic via bit-manipulations; (e) distributed computing infrastructure for multidimensional subset sum; (f) arbitrary-precision zero-margin-of-error multidimensional Subset Sum accelerated by a simplified Bloom filter. The package contains a copy of 'xxHash' from <https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash>. Package vignette (<doi:10.48550/arXiv.1612.04484>) detailed a few historical updates.

The ensemble use generic functions 'predict()' and 'forecast()' to forecast future values of the time series. Moreover, an ensemble can be updated using methods, such as 'update_weights()' or 'update_base_models()'.

Prior distributions on coefficients are from Zellner's g-prior or mixtures of g-priors corresponding to the Zellner-Siow Cauchy Priors or the mixture of g-priors from Liang et al (2008) <DOI:10.1198/016214507000001337> for linear models or mixtures of g-priors from  Li and Clyde (2019) <DOI:10.1080/01621459.2018.1469992> in generalized linear models. Other model selection criteria include AIC, BIC and Empirical Bayes estimates of g. Sampling probabilities may be updated based on the sampled models using sampling w/out replacement or an efficient MCMC algorithm which samples models using a tree structure of the model space as an efficient hash table.  See  Clyde, Ghosh and Littman (2010) <DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.09049> for  details on the sampling algorithms. Uniform priors over all models or beta-binomial prior distributions on model size are allowed, and for large p truncated priors on the model space may be used to enforce sampling models that are full rank. The user may force variables to always be included in addition to imposing constraints that higher order interactions are included only if their parents are included in the model.
