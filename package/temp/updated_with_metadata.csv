In fact, under the common priors for the variance, useful quantities in the original data scale (like mean and quantiles) do not have posterior moments that are finite (Fabrizi et al. 2012 <doi:10.1214/12-BA733>). This package allows to easily carry out a proper Bayesian inferential procedure by fixing a suitable distribution (the generalized inverse Gaussian) as prior for the variance. Functions to estimate several kind of means (unconditional, conditional and conditional under a mixed model) and quantiles (unconditional and conditional) are provided.",R
