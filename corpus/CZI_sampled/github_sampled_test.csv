ESEfinder;https://github.com/MahyarHosseini/ESEfinder;10.1186/1756-0500-1-86;ESEfinder 3.0 [21] was used to scan the genomic region containing SNPs found only among affected individuals in the screening panel for the identification of splice enhancer binding sites in the wildtype sequence
ESEfinder;https://github.com/MahyarHosseini/ESEfinder;10.1242/dmm.036616;The c.1226 A>G mutation, with its flanking sequences, was predicted as a potential ESE motif using ESEfinder software, and the motif sequence carrying the mutant G allele presented a higher weighted majority vote (WMV) score than that carrying the A allele (3.19 versus 2.82), suggesting that the G allele potentially increased binding affinity for SRSF2 (a member of the family of pre-mRNA splicing factors) and contributed to a high incidence of alternative splicing (AS)
