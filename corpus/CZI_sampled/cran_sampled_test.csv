chngpt;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/chngpt/index.html;10.1186/s12859-017-1863-x;"Our chngpt package complements the segmented package by making three unique contributions: (1) it supports all four types of threshold effects in Fig. 1, and supports models with interaction terms between predictors subjected to thresholding and predictors not subjected to thresholding [10]; (2) the search method in segmented employs a first order approximation of the non-smooth criterion function [11], while chngpt offers two alternative search methods: exact, which optimizes the exact criterion function, "
