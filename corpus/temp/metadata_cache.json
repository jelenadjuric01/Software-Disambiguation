They achieve this by transforming proximities/distances with explicit power functions and penalizing the fitting criterion with a clusteredness index, the OPTICS Cordillera (Rusch, Hornik & Mair, 2018, <doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1349664>). There are two variants: One for finding the configuration directly (COPS-C) with given explicit power transformations and implicit ratio, interval and non-metric optimal scaling transformations (Borg & Groenen, 2005, ISBN:978-0-387-28981-6), and one for using the augmented fitting criterion to find optimal hyperparameters for the explicit transformations (P-COPS). The package contains various functions, wrappers, methods and classes for fitting, plotting and displaying a large number of different MDS models (most of the functionality in smacofx) in the COPS framework. The package further contains a function for pattern search optimization, the ``Adaptive Luus-Jaakola Algorithm'' (Rusch, Mair & Hornik, 2021,<doi:10.1080/10618600.2020.1869027>) and a functions to calculate the phi-distances for count data or histograms.",

The\napproach generally follows the ideas of Goldsmith, Bobb, Crainiceanu,\nCaffo, and Reich (2011)<DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.10007> and the approach taken in their sample code, but\nwith some modifications to make it more feasible to use with long rather\nthan wide, non-rectangular longitudinal datasets with unequal and\npotentially random measurement times.  It also allows easy plotting of the\ncorrelation between the smoothed covariate and the outcome as a function of\ntime, which can add additional insights on how to interpret a functional\nregression.  Additionally, it also provides several permutation tests for\nthe significance of the functional predictor.  The heuristic interpretation\nof ``time'' is used to describe the index of the functional predictor, but\nthe same methods can equally be used for another unidimensional continuous\nindex, such as space along a north-south axis.  Note that most of the functionality\nof this package has been superseded by added features after 2016 in the 'pfr' function by\nJonathan Gellar, Mathew W. McLean, Jeff Goldsmith, and Fabian Scheipl, in the\n'refund' package built by Jeff Goldsmith and co-authors and maintained by Julia Wrobel.\nThe development of the funreg package in 2015 and 2016 was part of a research\nproject supported by Award R03 CA171809-01 from the National Cancer Institute and Award P50\nDA010075 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

    "description": "\"Writing in the Margins\" (WiM) is a new approach that leverages the chunked prefilling of the KV-Cache to perform a segment-wise inference, which enable efficient processing of extensive context along with generation and classification of intermediate information (\"margins\"), that guide the model towards specific tasks. This method increases computation marginally while significantly enhancing the performance of off-the-shelf models without the need for fine-tuning Additionally, we show how the proposed pattern fits into interactive retrieval design that provides end- users with ongoing updates about the progress of context processing and pinpoints the integration of relevant information into the final response.\n",

    "description": "The remit of the European Clinical Trials Data Base (EudraCT <https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/> ), or ClinicalTrials.gov <https://clinicaltrials.gov/>, is to provide open access to summaries of all registered clinical trial results; thus aiming to prevent non-reporting of negative results and provide open-access to results to inform future research. The amount of information required and the format of the results, however, imposes a large extra workload at the end of studies on clinical trial units. In particular, the adverse-event-reporting component requires entering: each unique combination of treatment group and safety event; for every such event above, a further 4 pieces of information (body system, number of occurrences, number of subjects, number exposed) for non-serious events, plus an extra three pieces of data for serious adverse events (numbers of causally related events, deaths, causally related deaths). This package prepares the required statistics needed by EudraCT and formats them into the precise requirements to directly upload an XML file into the web portal, with no further data entry by hand.",

Some background on these topics can be found in a recent paper \"Recent advances in conservation and population genomics data analysis\" by Hendricks et al.

The internal representation is an S4\nclass, which allows us to keep the syntax identical to that of base R's.\nInteraction between floats and base types for binary operators is generally\npossible; in these cases, type promotion always defaults to the higher\nprecision.

Bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphs representing joint\nprobability distributions, where each node represents a random variable and\neach edge represents conditionality. The full joint distribution is therefore\nfactorized as a product of conditional densities, where each node is assumed\nto be independent of its non-descendents given information on its parent nodes.\nSince exact, closed-form algorithms are computationally burdensome for inference\nwithin hybrid networks that contain a combination of continuous and discrete\nnodes, particle-based approximation techniques like Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nare popular. We provide a user-friendly interface to constructing these networks\nand running inference using the 'rjags' package. Econometric analyses (maximum\nexpected utility under competing policies, value of information) involving\ndecision and utility nodes are also supported.",

It checks whether your\np-values match their accompanying test statistic and degrees of\nfreedom. statcheck searches for null-hypothesis significance test\n(NHST) in APA style (e.g., t(28) = 2.2, p < .05). It recalculates the\np-value using the reported test statistic and degrees of freedom. If\nthe reported and computed p-values don't match, statcheck will flag\nthe result as an error. If the reported p-value is statistically\nsignificant and the recomputed one is not, or vice versa, the result\nwill be flagged as a decision error.  You can use statcheck directly\non a string of text, but you can also scan a PDF or HTML file, or even\na folder of PDF and/or HTML files.  Statcheck needs an external\nprogram to convert PDF to text: Xpdf. Instructions on where and how to\ndownload this program, how to install statcheck, and more details on\nwhat statcheck can and cannot do can be found in the online manual:\n<https://rpubs.com/michelenuijten/statcheckmanual>.

STAR models the observed count data using a rounded\ncontinuous data model and incorporates a transformation for greater flexibility.\nImplicitly, STAR formalizes the commonly-applied yet incoherent procedure of\n(i) transforming count-valued data and subsequently\n(ii) modeling the transformed data using Gaussian models.\nSTAR is well-defined for count-valued data, which is reflected in predictive accuracy,\nand is designed to account for zero-inflation, bounded or censored data, and over- or underdispersion.\nImportantly, STAR is easy to combine with existing MCMC or point estimation\nmethods for continuous data, which allows seamless adaptation of continuous data\nmodels (such as linear regressions, additive models, BART, random forests,\nand gradient boosting machines) for count-valued data. The package also includes several\nmethods for modeling count time series data, namely via warped Dynamic Linear Models.\nFor more details and background on these methodologies, see the works of\nKowal and Canale (2020) <doi:10.1214/20-EJS1707>,\nKowal and Wu (2022) <doi:10.1111/biom.13617>,\nKing and Kowal (2022) <arXiv:2110.14790>, and\nKowal and Wu (2023) <arXiv:2110.12316>.",

Recently, we found that the newly incorporated spacer in the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) could serve as an effective marker for typing of Salmonella. It was further revealed by Li et. al (2014) <doi:10.1128/JCM.00696-14> that recognized types based on the combination of two newly incorporated spacer in both CRISPR loci showed high accordance with serotypes. Here, we developed an R package 'CSESA' to predict the serotype based on this finding. Considering it’s time saving and of high accuracy, we recommend to predict the serotypes of unknown Salmonella isolates using 'CSESA' before doing the traditional serotyping.",

    "description": "[Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing) is an encoding that removes all 0 bytes\nfrom arbitrary binary data. The encoded data consists only of bytes with values from 0x01 to 0xFF. This is useful for preparing data for\ntransmission over a serial link (RS-232 or RS-485 for example), as the 0 byte can be used to unambiguously indicate packet boundaries. COBS\nalso has the advantage of adding very little overhead (at least 1 byte, plus up to an additional byte per 254 bytes of data). For messages\nsmaller than 254 bytes, the overhead is constant. \nThis is an implementation of COBS for C. It is designed to be both efficient and robust. The code is implemented in modern C99. The decoder\nis designed to detect  malformed input data and report an error upon detection. A test suite is included to validate the encoder and decoder. \n",

In such case, the backward elimination algorithm and the bootstrap restarting iterative segmented quantile algorithm are combined to select the number of change points based on a quantile BIC.

To address\nthis need, the Neyman-Pearson (NP) classification paradigm is a natural choice;\nit minimizes type II error (i.e., the conditional probability of misclassifying\na class 1 observation as class 0) while enforcing an upper bound, alpha, on the\ntype I error. Although the NP paradigm has a century-long history in hypothesis\ntesting, it has not been well recognized and implemented in classification\nschemes. Common practices that directly limit the empirical type I error to\nno more than alpha do not satisfy the type I error control objective because\nthe resulting classifiers are still likely to have type I errors much larger\nthan alpha. As a result, the NP paradigm has not been properly implemented\nfor many classification scenarios in practice. In this work, we develop the\nfirst umbrella algorithm that implements the NP paradigm for all scoring-type\nclassification methods, including popular methods such as logistic regression,\nsupport vector machines and random forests. Powered by this umbrella algorithm,\nwe propose a novel graphical tool for NP classification methods: NP receiver\noperating characteristic (NP-ROC) bands, motivated by the popular receiver\noperating characteristic (ROC) curves. NP-ROC bands will help choose in a data\nadaptive way and compare different NP classifiers.",

The rWHALE backend software runs these different\napplications for the user, taking the outputs from some programs and\nproviding them as inputs to others. The design of the R2D\napplication is such that researchers are able to modify the backend\napplications to utilize their own application in the workflow\ncomputations. This will ensure researchers are not limited to using\nthe default applications we provide and will be enthused to provide\ntheir own applications for others to use. \nThis application is under active development. Researchers are encouraged to comment on what additional\nfeatures and applications they would like to see in this\napplication. If you want it, chances are many of your colleagues also\nwould benefit from it. \nPlease visit the [R2D Research Tool webpage](http://simcenter-messageboard.designsafe-ci.org/smf/index.php?board=8.0)\nfor more resources related to this tool.

While several 'R' packages have been developed to interface 'sigma.js', all were developed for v1.x.x and none have migrated to v2.4.0 nor are they planning to. This package builds upon the 'sigmaNet' package, and users familiar with it will recognize the similar design approach. Two extensions have been added to the classic 'sigma.js' visualizations by overriding the underlying 'JavaScript' code, enabling to draw a frame around node labels, and to display labels on multiple lines by parsing line breaks. Other additional functionalities that did not require overriding 'sigma.js' code include toggling node visibility when clicked using a node attribute and highlighting specific edges. 'sigma.js' is currently preparing a stable release v3.0.0, and this package plans to update to it when it is available.",

These models account for the correlated nature of observations within higher level units by adding group-level error terms that augment the singular residual error of a standard OLS regression. Multilevel and mixed effects models often require specialized data pre-processing and further post-estimation derivations and graphics to gain insight into model results. The package presented here, 'mlmtools', is a suite of pre- and post-estimation tools for multilevel models in 'R'. Package implements post-estimation tools designed to work with models estimated using 'lme4''s (Bates et al., 2014) lmer() function, which fits linear mixed effects regression models. Searle, S.

A test may be statistically\nsignificant, yet practically inconsequential (Fritz, Scherndl, & Kühberger, 2012\n<doi:10.1177/0959354312436870>). Although the American Psychological Association\nhas long advocated for the inclusion of effect sizes (Wilkinson & American\nPsychological Association Task Force on Statistical Inference, 1999\n<doi:10.1037/0003-066X.54.8.594>), the vast majority of peer-reviewed,\npublished academic studies stop short of reporting effect sizes and confidence\nintervals (Cumming, 2013, <doi:10.1177/0956797613504966>).

    "description": "Introduction: \nThe data volume generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is growing at a pace that is now challenging the storage and data processing capacities of modern computer systems. In this context an important aspect is the reduction of data complexity by collapsing redundant reads in a single cluster to improve the run time, memory requirements, and quality of post-processing steps like assembly. Several alignment-free measures, based on k-mers counts, have been used to cluster reads. Quality scores produced by NGS platforms are fundamental for various analysis of NGS data: reads mapping; error detection; etc. Moreover future-generation sequencing reads promise to contain a large number of erroneous bases (up to 10$\\%$). Thus it will be fundamental to exploit quality value information within the alignment-free framework. We have introduced a family of alignment-free measures, called $D^q$-type, that incorporate quality value information and k-mers counts for the comparison of reads data. A set of experiments on simulated and real reads data confirm that the new measures are superior to other classical alignment-free statistics, especially when erroneous reads are considered. \nWhere dist_type is the distance used for the clustering, num_cluster is the number of partitions in which you want to divide the set of sequences and kmer_length is the length of the words used by the algorithm. The input file (file_fastq) must be in fastq format, as it is defined in Illumina 1.8+ (Phred+33). The program returns on standard output the list of sequences with the number of the corresponding cluster. With the '-w' option the program also outputs the clusters in different files. Use the option '-h' to get the complete list of options. \nThe software is freely available for academic use. \nM. Comin, A. Leoni, M.

    "description": "Introduction: \nThe data volume generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is growing at a pace that is now challenging the storage and data processing capacities of modern computer systems. In this context an important aspect is the reduction of data complexity by collapsing redundant reads in a single cluster to improve the run time, memory requirements, and quality of post-processing steps like assembly. Several alignment-free measures, based on k-mers counts, have been used to cluster reads. Quality scores produced by NGS platforms are fundamental for various analysis of NGS data: reads mapping; error detection; etc. Moreover future-generation sequencing reads promise to contain a large number of erroneous bases (up to 10$\\%$). Thus it will be fundamental to exploit quality value information within the alignment-free framework. We have introduced a family of alignment-free measures, called $D^q$-type, that incorporate quality value information and k-mers counts for the comparison of reads data. A set of experiments on simulated and real reads data confirm that the new measures are superior to other classical alignment-free statistics, especially when erroneous reads are considered. \nWhere dist_type is the distance used for the clustering, num_cluster is the number of partitions in which you want to divide the set of sequences and kmer_length is the length of the words used by the algorithm. The input file (file_fastq) must be in fastq format, as it is defined in Illumina 1.8+ (Phred+33). The program returns on standard output the list of sequences with the number of the corresponding cluster. With the '-w' option the program also outputs the clusters in different files. Use the option '-h' to get the complete list of options. \nThe software is freely available for academic use. \nM. Comin, A. Leoni, M.

The classifier contains optimized mean profiles of the classes (centroids) as observed in the training data, and new samples are matched to these centroids using the shortest Euclidean distance. Centroids derived from a dataset of 1,598 ALL patients are included, but users can train the models with their own data as well.

APA style has to be implemented when submitting scientific reports in a wide range of research fields, especially in the social sciences. The default output of numbers in the R console or R Markdown and Quarto documents does not meet the APA style requirements, and reformatting results manually can be cumbersome and error-prone. This package covers the automatic conversion of R objects to textual representations that meet the APA style requirements, which can be included in R Markdown or Quarto documents. It covers some basic statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, correlation, chi-squared test, Wilcoxon test) as well as some basic number printing manipulations (formatting p-values, removing leading zeros for numbers that cannot be greater than one, and others). Other packages exist for formatting numbers and tests according to the APA style guidelines, such as 'papaja' (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=papaja>) and 'apa' (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=apa>), but they do not offer all convenience functionality included in 'prmisc'.

    "description": "Flow Scheduling is crucial in data centers, as it directly influences user experience of applications. Many flow scheduling solutions leverage priority queues of commodity switches to enforce their scheduling policies. Given the limited number of priority queues, e.g., 8, flow scheduling solutions should choose the most appropriate queue for each outgoing packet. According to different assumptions and design goals, there are four typical flow scheduling problems: SRPT, LAS, Fair Queuing, and Deadline-Aware Scheduling. Most existing works often address one scheduling problem, and seldom handle a key challenge: how to set an appropriate threshold for each queue. This paper unifies the flow scheduling problem as a clustering problem: how to cluster outgoing packets into k queues? To address this problem, we propose a generic framework, namely QCluster, which can address the above challenge. Based on k-means, QCluster clusters packets with the similar weights into the same queue at line rate. For different flow scheduling problems, packet weight has different definitions (e.g., remaining size, bytes sent). QCluster has two key differences with existing works: 1) QCluster is easy to be deployed with two options: only deployed in programmable switches; or only deployed in end hosts. 2) QCluster can automatically adjust the thresholds of queues for each switch at line rate. Experimental results on testbeds with P4Switch and ns-2 show that QCluster achieves comparable or better performance compared with the best algorithm for each scheduling problem. QCluster can reduce the overall average flow completion time (FCT) up to 21.7%, and reduce the average FCT for short flows up to 56.6% over existing solutions.\n",

The cross-validated\npermutation variable importance is not based on the out-of-bag\nobservations but uses a similar strategy which is inspired by\nthe cross-validation procedure. The novel test approach can be\napplied for classification trees as well as for regression\ntrees. However, the use of the novel testing approach has not\nbeen tested for regression trees so far, so this routine is\nmeant for the expert user only and its current state is rather\nexperimental.",
