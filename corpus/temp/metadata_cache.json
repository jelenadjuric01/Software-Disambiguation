They achieve this by transforming proximities/distances with explicit power functions and penalizing the fitting criterion with a clusteredness index, the OPTICS Cordillera (Rusch, Hornik & Mair, 2018, <doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1349664>). There are two variants: One for finding the configuration directly (COPS-C) with given explicit power transformations and implicit ratio, interval and non-metric optimal scaling transformations (Borg & Groenen, 2005, ISBN:978-0-387-28981-6), and one for using the augmented fitting criterion to find optimal hyperparameters for the explicit transformations (P-COPS). The package contains various functions, wrappers, methods and classes for fitting, plotting and displaying a large number of different MDS models (most of the functionality in smacofx) in the COPS framework. The package further contains a function for pattern search optimization, the ``Adaptive Luus-Jaakola Algorithm'' (Rusch, Mair & Hornik, 2021,<doi:10.1080/10618600.2020.1869027>) and a functions to calculate the phi-distances for count data or histograms.",

The\napproach generally follows the ideas of Goldsmith, Bobb, Crainiceanu,\nCaffo, and Reich (2011)<DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.10007> and the approach taken in their sample code, but\nwith some modifications to make it more feasible to use with long rather\nthan wide, non-rectangular longitudinal datasets with unequal and\npotentially random measurement times.  It also allows easy plotting of the\ncorrelation between the smoothed covariate and the outcome as a function of\ntime, which can add additional insights on how to interpret a functional\nregression.  Additionally, it also provides several permutation tests for\nthe significance of the functional predictor.  The heuristic interpretation\nof ``time'' is used to describe the index of the functional predictor, but\nthe same methods can equally be used for another unidimensional continuous\nindex, such as space along a north-south axis.  Note that most of the functionality\nof this package has been superseded by added features after 2016 in the 'pfr' function by\nJonathan Gellar, Mathew W. McLean, Jeff Goldsmith, and Fabian Scheipl, in the\n'refund' package built by Jeff Goldsmith and co-authors and maintained by Julia Wrobel.\nThe development of the funreg package in 2015 and 2016 was part of a research\nproject supported by Award R03 CA171809-01 from the National Cancer Institute and Award P50\nDA010075 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

    "description": "\"Writing in the Margins\" (WiM) is a new approach that leverages the chunked prefilling of the KV-Cache to perform a segment-wise inference, which enable efficient processing of extensive context along with generation and classification of intermediate information (\"margins\"), that guide the model towards specific tasks. This method increases computation marginally while significantly enhancing the performance of off-the-shelf models without the need for fine-tuning Additionally, we show how the proposed pattern fits into interactive retrieval design that provides end- users with ongoing updates about the progress of context processing and pinpoints the integration of relevant information into the final response.\n",

    "description": "The remit of the European Clinical Trials Data Base (EudraCT <https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/> ), or ClinicalTrials.gov <https://clinicaltrials.gov/>, is to provide open access to summaries of all registered clinical trial results; thus aiming to prevent non-reporting of negative results and provide open-access to results to inform future research. The amount of information required and the format of the results, however, imposes a large extra workload at the end of studies on clinical trial units. In particular, the adverse-event-reporting component requires entering: each unique combination of treatment group and safety event; for every such event above, a further 4 pieces of information (body system, number of occurrences, number of subjects, number exposed) for non-serious events, plus an extra three pieces of data for serious adverse events (numbers of causally related events, deaths, causally related deaths). This package prepares the required statistics needed by EudraCT and formats them into the precise requirements to directly upload an XML file into the web portal, with no further data entry by hand.",
