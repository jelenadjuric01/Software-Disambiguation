Distance-sampling is popular in ecology, especially when survey targets are observed from aerial platforms (e.g., airplane or drone), surface vessels (e.g., boat or truck), or along walking transects. Distance-sampling includes line-transect studies that measure observation distances as the closest approach of the sample route (transect) to the target (i.e., perpendicular off-transect distance), and point-transect studies that measure observation distances from stationary observers to the target (i.e., radial distance). The routines included here fit smooth (parametric) curves to histograms of observation distances and use those functions to compute effective sampling distances, density of targets in the surveyed area, and abundance of targets in a surrounding study area. Curve shapes include the half-normal, hazard rate, and negative exponential functions. Physical measurement units are required and used throughout to ensure density is reported correctly.

In order to support genome-wide analyses, these models are designed to accept any type of protein as input and calculation of compositional properties has been optimised for high-throughput use.

The alternative, """"mature"""", model is best suited for mature peptide sequences that represent the final antimicrobial peptide sequence after post-translational processing.
