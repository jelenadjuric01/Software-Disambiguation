In this context an important aspect is the reduction of data complexity by collapsing redundant reads in a single cluster to improve the run time, memory requirements, and quality of post-processing steps like assembly. Several alignment-free measures, based on k-mers counts, have been used to cluster reads. Quality scores produced by NGS platforms are fundamental for various analysis of NGS data: reads mapping; error detection; etc. Moreover future-generation sequencing reads promise to contain a large number of erroneous bases (up to 10$\%$). Thus it will be fundamental to exploit quality value information within the alignment-free framework. We have introduced a family of alignment-free measures, called $D^q$-type, that incorporate quality value information and k-mers counts for the comparison of reads data. A set of experiments on simulated and real reads data confirm that the new measures are superior to other classical alignment-free statistics, especially when erroneous reads are considered.  Where dist_type is the distance used for the clustering, num_cluster is the number of partitions in which you want to divide the set of sequences and kmer_length is the length of the words used by the algorithm.

It incorporates two support vector machine models (""""precursor"""" and """"mature"""") trained on publicly available antimicrobial peptide data using calculated physico-chemical and compositional sequence properties described in Meher et al. (2017) <doi:10.1038/srep42362>. In order to support genome-wide analyses, these models are designed to accept any type of protein as input and calculation of compositional properties has been optimised for high-throughput use. For best results it is important to select the model that accurately represents your sequence type: for full length proteins, it is recommended to use the default """"precursor"""" model. The alternative, """"mature"""", model is best suited for mature peptide sequences that represent the final antimicrobial peptide sequence after post-translational processing.
