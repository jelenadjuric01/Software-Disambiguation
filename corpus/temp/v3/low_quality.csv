It incorporates two support vector machine models (""""precursor"""" and """"mature"""") trained on publicly available antimicrobial peptide data using calculated physico-chemical and compositional sequence properties described in Meher et al. (2017) <doi:10.1038/srep42362>. In order to support genome-wide analyses, these models are designed to accept any type of protein as input and calculation of compositional properties has been optimised for high-throughput use. For best results it is important to select the model that accurately represents your sequence type: for full length proteins, it is recommended to use the default """"precursor"""" model. The alternative, """"mature"""", model is best suited for mature peptide sequences that represent the final antimicrobial peptide sequence after post-translational processing.

First, each marker on the genome is scanned. Bonferroni correction is replaced by a less stringent selection criterion for significant test. Then, all the markers that are potentially associated with the trait are included in a multi-locus genetic model, their effects are estimated by empirical Bayes, and all the nonzero effects were further identified by likelihood ratio test for significant QTL. The program may run on a desktop or laptop computers. If marker genotypes in association mapping population are almost homozygous, these methods in this software are very effective.
