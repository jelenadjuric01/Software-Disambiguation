Bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphs representing joint probability distributions, where each node represents a random variable and each edge represents conditionality. The full joint distribution is therefore factorized as a product of conditional densities, where each node is assumed to be independent of its non-descendents given information on its parent nodes. Since exact, closed-form algorithms are computationally burdensome for inference within hybrid networks that contain a combination of continuous and discrete nodes, particle-based approximation techniques like Markov Chain Monte Carlo are popular. We provide a user-friendly interface to constructing these networks and running inference using the 'rjags' package.

Distance-sampling is popular in ecology, especially when survey targets are observed from aerial platforms (e.g., airplane or drone), surface vessels (e.g., boat or truck), or along walking transects. Distance-sampling includes line-transect studies that measure observation distances as the closest approach of the sample route (transect) to the target (i.e., perpendicular off-transect distance), and point-transect studies that measure observation distances from stationary observers to the target (i.e., radial distance). The routines included here fit smooth (parametric) curves to histograms of observation distances and use those functions to compute effective sampling distances, density of targets in the surveyed area, and abundance of targets in a surrounding study area. Curve shapes include the half-normal, hazard rate, and negative exponential functions. Physical measurement units are required and used throughout to ensure density is reported correctly.
